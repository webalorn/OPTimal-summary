[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> When you see your crus. grab his gaze and hold it. Smile at him. Hold that look for a few seconds and then look away. Repeat it again and if he’s interested he’ll mirror your cues.


Use the flick technique: Meet his eye. let your gaze fall to his mout. and then lift them so that your eyes meet his again. Pair that with a coy grin.When you know he’s watching yo. play with your hair a little. This lets him know that you notice him noticing you.
Fake it till you make it. The more you allow yourself to relax into the situation and feel comfortable with i. the more confident you will seem. Confidence is an aphrodisiac for men so use it generously.


Don’t fidget with or hide your hands as its often a sign of nervousness. Place them on your hips or leave them out in the open to promote better posture and signal to him that you are open.
Keep your chin up and eyes level at all time. even as you walk to project confidence.
Take care of your appearance. Groom with products that leave you smelling good and feeling good: like conditioner. lotion. fragrance. etc. Pay attention to the details.
 He’ll remember you from your back and forth looks. Comment offhandedly about something in class or make a joke. This takes the pressure off an initial one-on-one encounter and can feel a lot more organic than the individual approach attempt.
 If you’re feeling brav. approach him directly. If no. make approaching him more comfortable by setting the scene. The setup will provide the icebreaker you need to get the conversation going.


Bump into him and apologize frantically. Place your hand in your hair and laugh at yourself for running into him.
Drop somethin. like a book or a pe. as you walk past him. He will either run after you to return it to you or you can retrieve it yourself and explain that you are clumsy.
 This will always be the boldest move because it’s direc. straightforwar. and lacks the presence of games. The simplest thing to say is: “H. I’m Ashle. what’s your name?”If in-person introductions intimidate yo. create an indirect approach to introducing yourself.
Add him on Facebook or Instagram. Message him directly by giving your name and telling him where he might know you from (school or work). Tell him you have noticed him from afar and have been dying to talk to him and let him know your name.
Direct message him on Twitter introducing yourself as his classmate or coworker Ashley. Use your shyness to your advantage by saying that he makes you so shy in person that Twitter messaging became the next best thing to hello.
Get his number from a mutual friend. This one is a little risky because a lot of people do not like to have their numbers handed out if it is not from them directl. but if you make up a good excus. you might be able to make this move work in your favor. Apologize for having his number and tell him that you missed notes in clas. heard he would have the. and really need it to study for an upcoming test. This looks more proactiv. less craz. so if you’re going to text hi. make sure you have a reason and take the conversation from there.
 Light topics will always be easier to expound upon into deeper topics later. Ask about the weather or ask if he went to the school’s last game. Ask him how he’s doing today or what he’s up to.


”What kind of day are you having?”
”What are you studying?”
”Where do you work?”
”What are you doing later?”

, Ask questions that are open-ended and lead to him describing his likes and dislike. his passion. and his interests. Listen to his responses more than you speak. ”What kind of movies do you like? What are your favorites?”
”What do you like to read in your spare time?”
”What is the most beautiful place you’ve ever been?”
”Where do you plan to travel to this year?”
”What’s one thing that you’re reall. really good at?”

, Men like praise and appreciation as much as women do. The act itself puts into words your interest in him. Slip into the conversation organically and limit the compliments to a couple at a time.If he smiles while you’re talking: “You have an incredible smile.”
If he laughs at something funny: “Your laugh is music.”
If he has a great sense of humor: “You are really funny.”
If you like what he’s wearing: “You have really great style.”
If you want to mention his looks but not directl. wait for him to do something that’s cut. like talking about a hobby passionately: “You’re so cute.”

, Make things feel less formal and less like an interview by making conversation a two-way street. If he asks questions about you because he’s interested and wants to know mor. answer honestly and confidently.


Connect a shared passion or interest with a personal story to deepen the emotional connection between you two.
Allow him to get to know who you are and decide if he likes what he likes.
 Stare in his eyes intensely. Use body language to show him your interest. Touch him lightly on the arm or accidentally touch his le. knee. or feet with yours.
 Now that momentum has been made with creating a foundation for friendshi. see if there’s more there by hanging out one-on-one in a more intimate setting. Connection continues to build the more you bond through shared activities.Grab a bite to eat somewhere just the two of you.

If in doub. ask questions about her. Ask her where she's fro. who's she on vacation wit. and what sort of things she's seen since she got here. All of these questions can lead to positive conversations.
 If you're out on vacatio. there should be a wide range of activities available to you. Whether it's swimmin. hikin. partying or seeing a sho. you should keep the activities on-the-go and exciting.


When one activity end. start up another. This will show the girl that you are fun and spontaneous.
 If you're looking to meet a woman abroa. you should take advantage of this excitement. This is especially true if the woman is out vacationing herself. While you interact with he. don't hesitate or be afraid of potentially making a fool of yourself. Because you may only know this girl for a short amount of tim. there are far fewer repercussions than if you were approaching someone domestically.
 You can just as easily share these things with someone you just recently met. Whether it's going to a resort clu. taking a long swim or watching a tropical sunset togethe. the girl will associate positive feelings with you as she shares worthwhile experiences with you.
 Here are some of the things you should keep an eye out for if you're trying to figure out if she's interested:


If she's messaging you frequently throughout the vacatio. it's a good sign that she's interested in seeing more of you.
She's likely interested in pursuing things with you if she singles you out in a crow. or spends more time with you than the party she originally came on vacation with.
Typical body language signs of attractio. like twirling hair and sustained eye contac. should also be taken into account in this instanc. although you should consider potential differences in culture. Women from certain cultures will manifest their attraction in more subtle ways than what you're used to dealing with.
 Although you shouldn't jump in the second you meet a gir. you shouldn't wait to make your feelings and intentions known to her. If you feel you've arrived at an appropriate tim. jump on the chance and see what happens.


If it turns out that the girl isn't interested in yo. you shouldn't take it to heart. Vacation romances seldom work out as it i. and any pain you feel will be lessened by the time you get back home.
 Although part of this is the impression that someone won't be judged if she's away from the people she know. it's still paramount that you approach any potential sexual encounter with safety in mind. Failing to do so could result in sexually transmitted diseases or even pregnancy.

Keep the conversation light-hearted.Even if you're looking to make a serious romance with the girl you're talking wit. you shouldn't touch upon any serious topics when you're first chatting with her.

Take advantage of a vacation's excitement.Unlike a romance closer to hom. there's a much greater degree of excitement when you're out on vacation.
Share good experiences together.A vacation is meant to be a time where you get out and do things you're not familiar with.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Perhaps this is the biggest secret but reall. it's the clincher. The best way to impress a girl is to not set out to impress her. Now you might be wondering how this really works. The issue at heart is that when most guys try to impress girl. they tend to become less authentic and when this happen. they can try to show off with almost anything and everything. Girls are not impressed by such tactics and tend to end up putting you in the "show off" categor. unimpressed by the antics and bravado. The best way to impress a girl is to be yoursel. let things happen automatically and keep the show pony antics for your mates.
If you thought that girls are impressed by money and material things all the tim. then you are mistaken. The best way to impress a girl and retain your status is by the way of natural talents which involve the way you talk and present yourself. You need girls to respect you for who you are.


If the girl is impressed by your mone. then she is probably looking for money and not yo. so that's a good telltale sign to back off.
 Don't talk to her with the quest to impress rather try to do what you normally do. One of the best aspects which almost every girl demands and gets impressed by is intellectuality. Try to develop your intellectual skills. This can be done by the way to reading book. quality online articles and being up-to-date with the latest happenings. Remember that being a good talker is the foundation of impressing almost any girl.


Have something which is different from the rest. Girls normally get hit on by several men every day and almost all those men try to impress them with all they’ve got. If you are doing and following the same tactics as all those me. then you won't succeed in your quest to impress girls.
 Avoid being erotic or cras. that just scares girls off. Make it clear that you like her.


If she is insecur. anything you do to to get her attention must be positive and slow. When you take your tim. it shows her that you care enough to take it slowly.
 The way to melt a girl's heart is to show kindness and to be considerate of her needs. Notice the person she really is and compliment tha. not her look. clothes or "hotness". Actually show that you care about her by noticing her personalit. intelligenc. style and creativity.

Tell her she is pretty with no makeup and sweats with her hair in a messy bun or ponytail.
Compliment her on the care she has taken to present herself; she will feel appreciated when it's noticed.






Buy her a gif. like chocolate; it doesn't have to be special or expensiv. it's the obviousness that you were thinking about her in your free time that makes her blush.
If she is col. or just for fu. give her your sweatshirt or coat––it has your smell and she will like to wear it.
 There's nothing a girl likes more than being talked to by guy. even if there is an age difference.


Hold actual conversations with the girl and talk about the things that matter to both of yo. but let her do more of the talking to begin wit. to allow you to learn about her.
Don't tell tall stories to try to impress her. She'll see through it and you'll come across looking daft.
 Girls really want someone who will not let them down and who is a promise-keeper. If you can't do something you said you'd d. tell her the trut. don't make up stories.


Girls love a guy who cares about he. and who won't make fun of her if she's in a bad situation.
 Be playful in a fun and kind way. Also be wary of the following:


Don't make her feel awkward when she is with you.






Don't be a jerk. Girls hate it when you try to get their attention by putting other people off or making a bad comment about what someone looks like.
Don't be a horndog and make comments about "doin' it" with her; that's an immediate turnoff. Don't pressure her to do anything she doesn't don't want to do with you.
Don't brag about what you've done in intimacy with her to your mates. That's a code breaker and potentially a relationship breaker too.
 Call or contact her at least once a day when you see he. and twice when you don't. It helps her to feel special.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> People tend to use Western style riding for rodeos and ranching and it is more common in the U.S. than in other countrie. so you might have a harder time accessing Western equipment if you live somewhere that favors English style.


One nice thing about the Western saddle is that it has the hor. where you can grip onto if you're on an experienced rider.
 If this is the first time you're using this bit on this particular horse you definitely want to make sure that you're using the proper sized bridle. If it's the wrong size it will make the horse uncomfortable.Bridles comes in three sizes: pon. cob or Arabia. and full. Measure your horse’s head from the center of his poll to the corner of his mout. and compare this measurement to the crown and cheek piece of the bridle.
If the bit is too small it can pinch the horse’s mouth.
If the bit is too big it will slide around in the horse’s mouth.
 A horse can sense your fear and this will make them nervous. Als. remember that it can be nerve-wracking for a horse to have someone putting something metallic in their mouth.
 You need to make sure that your horse is secured. This means anticipating the moment when they are halter-free but you haven't yet buckle the bridle. You have to be able to control and keep hold of your horse.


For a tie statio. hold the bridle so that the front of the brow band faces forward (away from the horse). Drape the reins over their neck. Drop your left rein over the horse's neck so that it falls on the right. Drop the right rein so that it falls on the left. Allow the bridle to slip back on your arm. Lift the crown of the halter over the horse's ears and slip the halter's nose band dow. off their face. Bring the crown up and lay it behind their ears. Refasten their halter so it hands around the horse's neck.
If you don't have a tie station use the bridle reins to maintain hold of your horse. For split rein. tie them together and lift the reins over the horse's hea. setting them just behind their ears. Lift the halter's crown over the horse's ears and slip the halter nose band off your horse's face.
 You can offer them a piece of apple or sugar cube to make them their head. Put your hand right below their nose with the treat in it. When they drop their head that's when you'll put the bit in.


Make sure you’re grasping the crown of the bridle in your right hand. Angle in line with your horse’s left eye and right ear.
 Hold the bit low where you’ve been holding the treats. Gently set it against your horse’s teeth as close to where her top teeth meet her lower teeth as possible. Hold your sugar cube against the bit.

Make sure you put the bit in before you put the bridle’s crown over their ears.
Holding the crown of the bridle up in order to slip it on before you put the bit in their mouth.
Hold the bridle so that the two sides are a good distance apar. with the crown up and the throatlatch straps hanging free and not tangled in any other straps.
 You want to be careful that you don't crush your horse's ears. Lift the crown over your horse's left ear as you slip the crown to the poll. Gently slip the horse's right ear in front of the crown as well. Also gently push the horse's ears forward rather than backward.


If the bridle has earloops rather than a brow ban. position these around your horse’s ears now.
 Always make sure that you reward your horse for their good behavior. This will encourage them to be good about accepting the bit and the bridle.


Sugar also encourages them to play with the bi. so sugar cubes are a really good treat to have on hand for bridling.
, Remember that the throatlatch isn't there to hold the bridle in place. It operates as an extra precaution against the bridle coming off. This means that the throatlatch needs to be loose enough to maintain slac. even if the horse drops their head.


Make sure you can fit your entire hand between the throatlatch and the hors. even when their head is bent towards their neck.
 The brow band should be smooth and in the correct position. This means it won't be pinching your horse's ears or head. Check that the bit sits evenly in your horse's mouth. There should be two wrinkles on either corner of your horse's mouth. Too fewer and you need to shorten the cheek straps.


Make sure it sits evenly on your horse’s head. If you do have to adjust the cheek strap check that the rest of the headstall is still even.
Buckle curb chain or chin strap if that isn’t fixed.
This is when you should check the length of your reins. The need to be long enough that you can take up contact with your horse's mouth.
 Lead them on their lef. at their cheek. Hold the reins in your right hand about six inches below the bit. Keep the bight in your left hand. Always hold about six inches below the bit.


Keep the slack from the reins in your left hand.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Flirtation often comes down to the right body language. If you want to send your guy friend the signal you want a relationshi. work on flirting with your body when the two of you are together. If he is attracted to you as wel. this can help romantic feeling develop.Tilt your body towards him when you're having lunch togethe. watching a movi. or other times when you hang out.
Look him directly in the ey. bat your eyelashes and smile.
It may sound strang. but this is a form of flirtation that gets attention! Try to position your body the way his is when you're sitting together. Place your hands and feet in the same position as his hands and feet. If you're having coffe. take a sip when he does.Pick up some his expressions. If he has a tendency to sa. "Wo. that's interestin." for exampl. use this phrase on occasion.
Don't make it too obvious. He may think you're making fun of him! Imitate his gestures on occasio. but don't copy every single thing he does.
 Being attractive certainly helps someone notice you in a more than friends sense. When hanging out with hi. dress your best. Wear your most flattering clothes an. if you wear makeu. throw some on. Looking stunning can definitely help attract someone's romantic attention.Wear clothing that makes you feel good about yourself and that you feel comfortable in. You don't have to try to look like anyone but yourself.
 If you lack self confidenc. you're less likely to come off as attractive to other people. Having a strong sense of who you are will help your guy friend notice you. Do not simply agree with what he sees and smile and nod. Show off who you are while flirting!Think about how you see yourself as a person. Do you see yourself as smar. funn. spontaneou. seriou. studious? However you see yoursel. work on showing off that side for him.
For exampl. if you're a movie buf. don't hesitate to share your knowledge while the two of you hang out and watch movies.
 It's natural to develop feelings for someone if you spend a lot of time with that person. Try to frequent the same places he does. If you know he hangs out at a local coffee sho. spend time there. Invite him out with your friends for group gatherings. Go to social events where you know you'll see him.If you go to school togethe. try to interact with him frequently at school. Talk to him between classes. Sit by him in class whenever possible. Have lunch with him.
 People want to date those who are similar to them. If you have a lot in commo. play up these similarities. Do and say things to make him notice how alike you are. For exampl. if you both like a particular directo. talk about movies by that director.Maybe both of you are really interested in science fiction books or basketball. Find your common ground and emphasize it!

, If you're genuinely intrigued by some of his interest. explore them. For instanc. you can listen to a band he likes and then chat with him about it the next day. You could even ask him to check out their concert with you.


Be yourself! Don't force yourself to be interested in things that don't appeal to you just because he likes them.
 As friend. you may already hang out alone sometimes. Work on having a little more one-on-one time with him. This will give you a chance to get flirty in order to gain his attention. If you're nervou. go to a big social event and spend some time alone with him there.For exampl. ask him to a party and then find a cozy corner where the two of you can chat.
You can also try to hang out one-on-one in casual settings. For exampl. grab a cup of coffee together after school.
 If you're having trouble getting a guy to notice yo. try touching him whenever possible. This can help him think of you in a more romantic sense. For exampl. when you're having coffee togethe. try brushing his arm slightly when you're talking. Lean into him a little while you're watching a movie together.Do something flirty and playfu. like tussling his hair.
Hug him on occasion. A cozy hug once in awhile can eventually lead to more.
 Many people feel more comfortable transitioning into dating gradually. Try asking him what he's doing this weekend an. when he respond. suggest something the two of you could do together instead. For exampl. "Bowling sounds fun this weeken. but I have tickets to this concert if you want to go with me."Try asking him for advice on somewhere to g. and then ask him to go with you. For exampl. say: "Where do you get good pizza in this town?"
When he answer. say something lik. "O. cool. He. since you like that plac. maybe we could go together."

, If he's not getting the hin. don't be afraid to make the first move! Many guys actually appreciate when a potential romantic partner makes the move for them. Guys are shy to. so don't be afraid to make the first move.Remembe. this guy is your friend. This can help take some pressure off.
A friend is more likely to be polite and let you down eas. as well.
 When asking him ou. go at your own pace. Rushing through things can make you look nervou. making you both feel anxious in the situation. You want to start things off in a good plac. so slowly work your way up to asking him out when the time comes.Do not rush through your words. When the two of you do interact one-on-on. allow conversation to happen naturally for a bit before making your move.
If you're feeling nervou. take a few deep breaths to calm yourself.
 If indirect invitations aren't workin. it's time to be bold about your feelings. Simply say something lik. "S. I feel a strong romantic connection with you. Would you like to go out on a date some time?" You want to proceed with your relationshi. friendship or otherwis. with no confusion.While this may feel very bol. many people appreciate it when you're straightforward.
You can also emphasize how important his friendship is to you. You could say something lik. “I really do love being your friend and if you aren’t into me in a romantic wa. I just want you to know that I am happy with just being friends. Nothing about our friendship will change. I want to continue having fun with you and being your friend.”

, Even if you've done everything "righ." there's still a chance your guy friend just won't see you in that way. Remember this hurt will fade with time. While it seems like the end of the world no. you will eventually get over these feelings. Everyone gets rejected at some poin. so don’t let it affect your confidence. Beside. even if he doesn’t feel romantically about you no. that doesn’t mean he’ll always feel that way. Stay positive! No matter what happen. it doesn't reflect negatively on you as a person. You are awesom. with or without him!

For exampl. maybe you like that you are a loyal friend or maybe you like that you are kind to people. Write down the great qualities that you have and focus on these.
Don’t take it personally. Your crush's rejection likely has nothing to do with you. Your crush not having feelings for you is not a statement about you; it’s a statement about them. You are a perfectly lovely person who simply wasn’t meant to be with your crush.
There are so many reasons that your crush might not be intereste. and almost none of them have to do with you. Maybe your crush wasn’t ready for a relationship. Maybe they don’t have time right now. Maybe they don’t want to make a commitment to someone. Maybe they have feelings for someone else. Don’t question yourself. It’s their loss.
Make a list of everything else in your lif. such as the peopl. activitie. and interests that you have. This will help you to see yourself more clearly and not let one person’s rejection be blown out of proportion.


Don’t let your crush's rejection define you. There are so many other important aspects of your life. All of these things that make you happy help define who you are. You are the same wonderful person whether someone notices it or not. Your worth is never dependent on any other person. Seeing all of these other great parts of your life will help you to put one person's rejection in perspective. There are over seven billion people on our planet. So one of them didn’t like you. That’s ok! That one person might have felt like the whole world to yo. but they are simply one of many. There are probably millions of people who have similar characteristics as your crush. Now that you know what kind of person you are looking fo. you can open your eyes to all the other wonderful people out there.Over your lifetim. there will likely be many people who you like and many who like you. Sometimes you will like someone and they won’t like you back. Sometimes someone will like you and you won’t like them back. Sometimes you both won’t like each other. And every once in a while you will find someone who likes you as much as you like them. This is to be expected. This is what happens when there are so many different people in the world. Think of it as an adventure and journey to finding the right person rather than a form of rejection.

Use the flick technique: Meet his eye. let your gaze fall to his mout. and then lift them so that your eyes meet his again. Pair that with a coy grin.When you know he’s watching yo. play with your hair a little. This lets him know that you notice him noticing you.
Fake it till you make it. The more you allow yourself to relax into the situation and feel comfortable with i. the more confident you will seem. Confidence is an aphrodisiac for men so use it generously.


Don’t fidget with or hide your hands as its often a sign of nervousness. Place them on your hips or leave them out in the open to promote better posture and signal to him that you are open.
Keep your chin up and eyes level at all time. even as you walk to project confidence.
Take care of your appearance. Groom with products that leave you smelling good and feeling good: like conditioner. lotion. fragrance. etc. Pay attention to the details.
 He’ll remember you from your back and forth looks. Comment offhandedly about something in class or make a joke. This takes the pressure off an initial one-on-one encounter and can feel a lot more organic than the individual approach attempt.
 If you’re feeling brav. approach him directly. If no. make approaching him more comfortable by setting the scene. The setup will provide the icebreaker you need to get the conversation going.


Bump into him and apologize frantically. Place your hand in your hair and laugh at yourself for running into him.
Drop somethin. like a book or a pe. as you walk past him. He will either run after you to return it to you or you can retrieve it yourself and explain that you are clumsy.
 This will always be the boldest move because it’s direc. straightforwar. and lacks the presence of games. The simplest thing to say is: “H. I’m Ashle. what’s your name?”If in-person introductions intimidate yo. create an indirect approach to introducing yourself.
Add him on Facebook or Instagram. Message him directly by giving your name and telling him where he might know you from (school or work). Tell him you have noticed him from afar and have been dying to talk to him and let him know your name.
Direct message him on Twitter introducing yourself as his classmate or coworker Ashley. Use your shyness to your advantage by saying that he makes you so shy in person that Twitter messaging became the next best thing to hello.
Get his number from a mutual friend. This one is a little risky because a lot of people do not like to have their numbers handed out if it is not from them directl. but if you make up a good excus. you might be able to make this move work in your favor. Apologize for having his number and tell him that you missed notes in clas. heard he would have the. and really need it to study for an upcoming test. This looks more proactiv. less craz. so if you’re going to text hi. make sure you have a reason and take the conversation from there.
 Light topics will always be easier to expound upon into deeper topics later. Ask about the weather or ask if he went to the school’s last game. Ask him how he’s doing today or what he’s up to.


”What kind of day are you having?”
”What are you studying?”
”Where do you work?”
”What are you doing later?”

, Ask questions that are open-ended and lead to him describing his likes and dislike. his passion. and his interests. Listen to his responses more than you speak. ”What kind of movies do you like? What are your favorites?”
”What do you like to read in your spare time?”
”What is the most beautiful place you’ve ever been?”
”Where do you plan to travel to this year?”
”What’s one thing that you’re reall. really good at?”

, Men like praise and appreciation as much as women do. The act itself puts into words your interest in him. Slip into the conversation organically and limit the compliments to a couple at a time.If he smiles while you’re talking: “You have an incredible smile.”
If he laughs at something funny: “Your laugh is music.”
If he has a great sense of humor: “You are really funny.”
If you like what he’s wearing: “You have really great style.”
If you want to mention his looks but not directl. wait for him to do something that’s cut. like talking about a hobby passionately: “You’re so cute.”

, Make things feel less formal and less like an interview by making conversation a two-way street. If he asks questions about you because he’s interested and wants to know mor. answer honestly and confidently.


Connect a shared passion or interest with a personal story to deepen the emotional connection between you two.
Allow him to get to know who you are and decide if he likes what he likes.
 Stare in his eyes intensely. Use body language to show him your interest. Touch him lightly on the arm or accidentally touch his le. knee. or feet with yours.
 Now that momentum has been made with creating a foundation for friendshi. see if there’s more there by hanging out one-on-one in a more intimate setting. Connection continues to build the more you bond through shared activities.Grab a bite to eat somewhere just the two of you.

If in doub. ask questions about her. Ask her where she's fro. who's she on vacation wit. and what sort of things she's seen since she got here. All of these questions can lead to positive conversations.
 If you're out on vacatio. there should be a wide range of activities available to you. Whether it's swimmin. hikin. partying or seeing a sho. you should keep the activities on-the-go and exciting.


When one activity end. start up another. This will show the girl that you are fun and spontaneous.
 If you're looking to meet a woman abroa. you should take advantage of this excitement. This is especially true if the woman is out vacationing herself. While you interact with he. don't hesitate or be afraid of potentially making a fool of yourself. Because you may only know this girl for a short amount of tim. there are far fewer repercussions than if you were approaching someone domestically.
 You can just as easily share these things with someone you just recently met. Whether it's going to a resort clu. taking a long swim or watching a tropical sunset togethe. the girl will associate positive feelings with you as she shares worthwhile experiences with you.
 Here are some of the things you should keep an eye out for if you're trying to figure out if she's interested:


If she's messaging you frequently throughout the vacatio. it's a good sign that she's interested in seeing more of you.
She's likely interested in pursuing things with you if she singles you out in a crow. or spends more time with you than the party she originally came on vacation with.
Typical body language signs of attractio. like twirling hair and sustained eye contac. should also be taken into account in this instanc. although you should consider potential differences in culture. Women from certain cultures will manifest their attraction in more subtle ways than what you're used to dealing with.
 Although you shouldn't jump in the second you meet a gir. you shouldn't wait to make your feelings and intentions known to her. If you feel you've arrived at an appropriate tim. jump on the chance and see what happens.


If it turns out that the girl isn't interested in yo. you shouldn't take it to heart. Vacation romances seldom work out as it i. and any pain you feel will be lessened by the time you get back home.
 Although part of this is the impression that someone won't be judged if she's away from the people she know. it's still paramount that you approach any potential sexual encounter with safety in mind. Failing to do so could result in sexually transmitted diseases or even pregnancy.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Perhaps this is the biggest secret but reall. it's the clincher. The best way to impress a girl is to not set out to impress her. Now you might be wondering how this really works. The issue at heart is that when most guys try to impress girl. they tend to become less authentic and when this happen. they can try to show off with almost anything and everything. Girls are not impressed by such tactics and tend to end up putting you in the "show off" categor. unimpressed by the antics and bravado. The best way to impress a girl is to be yoursel. let things happen automatically and keep the show pony antics for your mates.
If you thought that girls are impressed by money and material things all the tim. then you are mistaken. The best way to impress a girl and retain your status is by the way of natural talents which involve the way you talk and present yourself. You need girls to respect you for who you are.


If the girl is impressed by your mone. then she is probably looking for money and not yo. so that's a good telltale sign to back off.
 Don't talk to her with the quest to impress rather try to do what you normally do. One of the best aspects which almost every girl demands and gets impressed by is intellectuality. Try to develop your intellectual skills. This can be done by the way to reading book. quality online articles and being up-to-date with the latest happenings. Remember that being a good talker is the foundation of impressing almost any girl.


Have something which is different from the rest. Girls normally get hit on by several men every day and almost all those men try to impress them with all they’ve got. If you are doing and following the same tactics as all those me. then you won't succeed in your quest to impress girls.
 Avoid being erotic or cras. that just scares girls off. Make it clear that you like her.


If she is insecur. anything you do to to get her attention must be positive and slow. When you take your tim. it shows her that you care enough to take it slowly.
 The way to melt a girl's heart is to show kindness and to be considerate of her needs. Notice the person she really is and compliment tha. not her look. clothes or "hotness". Actually show that you care about her by noticing her personalit. intelligenc. style and creativity.

Tell her she is pretty with no makeup and sweats with her hair in a messy bun or ponytail.
Compliment her on the care she has taken to present herself; she will feel appreciated when it's noticed.






Buy her a gif. like chocolate; it doesn't have to be special or expensiv. it's the obviousness that you were thinking about her in your free time that makes her blush.
If she is col. or just for fu. give her your sweatshirt or coat––it has your smell and she will like to wear it.
 There's nothing a girl likes more than being talked to by guy. even if there is an age difference.


Hold actual conversations with the girl and talk about the things that matter to both of yo. but let her do more of the talking to begin wit. to allow you to learn about her.
Don't tell tall stories to try to impress her. She'll see through it and you'll come across looking daft.
 Girls really want someone who will not let them down and who is a promise-keeper. If you can't do something you said you'd d. tell her the trut. don't make up stories.


Girls love a guy who cares about he. and who won't make fun of her if she's in a bad situation.
 Be playful in a fun and kind way. Also be wary of the following:


Don't make her feel awkward when she is with you.






Don't be a jerk. Girls hate it when you try to get their attention by putting other people off or making a bad comment about what someone looks like.
Don't be a horndog and make comments about "doin' it" with her; that's an immediate turnoff. Don't pressure her to do anything she doesn't don't want to do with you.
Don't brag about what you've done in intimacy with her to your mates. That's a code breaker and potentially a relationship breaker too.
 Call or contact her at least once a day when you see he. and twice when you don't. It helps her to feel special.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> People tend to use Western style riding for rodeos and ranching and it is more common in the U.S. than in other countrie. so you might have a harder time accessing Western equipment if you live somewhere that favors English style.


One nice thing about the Western saddle is that it has the hor. where you can grip onto if you're on an experienced rider.
 If this is the first time you're using this bit on this particular horse you definitely want to make sure that you're using the proper sized bridle. If it's the wrong size it will make the horse uncomfortable.Bridles comes in three sizes: pon. cob or Arabia. and full. Measure your horse’s head from the center of his poll to the corner of his mout. and compare this measurement to the crown and cheek piece of the bridle.
If the bit is too small it can pinch the horse’s mouth.
If the bit is too big it will slide around in the horse’s mouth.
 A horse can sense your fear and this will make them nervous. Als. remember that it can be nerve-wracking for a horse to have someone putting something metallic in their mouth.
 You need to make sure that your horse is secured. This means anticipating the moment when they are halter-free but you haven't yet buckle the bridle. You have to be able to control and keep hold of your horse.


For a tie statio. hold the bridle so that the front of the brow band faces forward (away from the horse). Drape the reins over their neck. Drop your left rein over the horse's neck so that it falls on the right. Drop the right rein so that it falls on the left. Allow the bridle to slip back on your arm. Lift the crown of the halter over the horse's ears and slip the halter's nose band dow. off their face. Bring the crown up and lay it behind their ears. Refasten their halter so it hands around the horse's neck.
If you don't have a tie station use the bridle reins to maintain hold of your horse. For split rein. tie them together and lift the reins over the horse's hea. setting them just behind their ears. Lift the halter's crown over the horse's ears and slip the halter nose band off your horse's face.
 You can offer them a piece of apple or sugar cube to make them their head. Put your hand right below their nose with the treat in it. When they drop their head that's when you'll put the bit in.


Make sure you’re grasping the crown of the bridle in your right hand. Angle in line with your horse’s left eye and right ear.
 Hold the bit low where you’ve been holding the treats. Gently set it against your horse’s teeth as close to where her top teeth meet her lower teeth as possible. Hold your sugar cube against the bit.

Make sure you put the bit in before you put the bridle’s crown over their ears.
Holding the crown of the bridle up in order to slip it on before you put the bit in their mouth.
Hold the bridle so that the two sides are a good distance apar. with the crown up and the throatlatch straps hanging free and not tangled in any other straps.
 You want to be careful that you don't crush your horse's ears. Lift the crown over your horse's left ear as you slip the crown to the poll. Gently slip the horse's right ear in front of the crown as well. Also gently push the horse's ears forward rather than backward.


If the bridle has earloops rather than a brow ban. position these around your horse’s ears now.
 Always make sure that you reward your horse for their good behavior. This will encourage them to be good about accepting the bit and the bridle.


Sugar also encourages them to play with the bi. so sugar cubes are a really good treat to have on hand for bridling.
, Remember that the throatlatch isn't there to hold the bridle in place. It operates as an extra precaution against the bridle coming off. This means that the throatlatch needs to be loose enough to maintain slac. even if the horse drops their head.


Make sure you can fit your entire hand between the throatlatch and the hors. even when their head is bent towards their neck.
 The brow band should be smooth and in the correct position. This means it won't be pinching your horse's ears or head. Check that the bit sits evenly in your horse's mouth. There should be two wrinkles on either corner of your horse's mouth. Too fewer and you need to shorten the cheek straps.


Make sure it sits evenly on your horse’s head. If you do have to adjust the cheek strap check that the rest of the headstall is still even.
Buckle curb chain or chin strap if that isn’t fixed.
This is when you should check the length of your reins. The need to be long enough that you can take up contact with your horse's mouth.
 Lead them on their lef. at their cheek. Hold the reins in your right hand about six inches below the bit. Keep the bight in your left hand. Always hold about six inches below the bit.


Keep the slack from the reins in your left hand.

Would you like to go out on a date some time?" You want to proceed with your relationshi. friendship or otherwis. with no confusion.While this may feel very bol. many people appreciate it when you're straightforward.
You can also emphasize how important his friendship is to you. You could say something lik. “I really do love being your friend and if you aren’t into me in a romantic wa. I just want you to know that I am happy with just being friends. Nothing about our friendship will change. I want to continue having fun with you and being your friend.”

, Even if you've done everything "righ." there's still a chance your guy friend just won't see you in that way. Remember this hurt will fade with time. While it seems like the end of the world no. you will eventually get over these feelings. Everyone gets rejected at some poin. so don’t let it affect your confidence. Beside. even if he doesn’t feel romantically about you no. that doesn’t mean he’ll always feel that way. Stay positive! No matter what happen. it doesn't reflect negatively on you as a person. You are awesom. with or without him!

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> If you find yourself taking it personally or doubting yoursel. try to build your confidence instead. Make a list of your favorite things about yourself and spend time nurturing these traits. That wa. if someone else doesn’t appreciate yo. it won’t seem so important because you know and appreciate yourself.


For exampl. maybe you like that you are a loyal friend or maybe you like that you are kind to people. Write down the great qualities that you have and focus on these.
Don’t take it personally. Your crush's rejection likely has nothing to do with you. Your crush not having feelings for you is not a statement about you; it’s a statement about them. You are a perfectly lovely person who simply wasn’t meant to be with your crush.
There are so many reasons that your crush might not be intereste. and almost none of them have to do with you. Maybe your crush wasn’t ready for a relationship. Maybe they don’t have time right now. Maybe they don’t want to make a commitment to someone. Maybe they have feelings for someone else. Don’t question yourself. It’s their loss.
Make a list of everything else in your lif. such as the peopl. activitie. and interests that you have. This will help you to see yourself more clearly and not let one person’s rejection be blown out of proportion.


Don’t let your crush's rejection define you. There are so many other important aspects of your life. All of these things that make you happy help define who you are. You are the same wonderful person whether someone notices it or not. Your worth is never dependent on any other person. Seeing all of these other great parts of your life will help you to put one person's rejection in perspective. There are over seven billion people on our planet. So one of them didn’t like you. That’s ok! That one person might have felt like the whole world to yo. but they are simply one of many. There are probably millions of people who have similar characteristics as your crush. Now that you know what kind of person you are looking fo. you can open your eyes to all the other wonderful people out there.Over your lifetim. there will likely be many people who you like and many who like you. Sometimes you will like someone and they won’t like you back. Sometimes someone will like you and you won’t like them back. Sometimes you both won’t like each other. And every once in a while you will find someone who likes you as much as you like them. This is to be expected. This is what happens when there are so many different people in the world. Think of it as an adventure and journey to finding the right person rather than a form of rejection.

Non-starchy root vegetables and leafy greens are great for your hamster. Try carrot. squas. broccol. cauliflowe. cucumbe. lettuc. and spinach.

 Just because a trick doesn't necessarily exist doesn't mean you can't teach it to your piggy anyway. Make up your own trick. use your min. and have fun with it! If you are both bored out of your mind. there is no point in training at all.

, I've said it onc. I'll say it again; guinea pigs are much more fragile than the average dog or ca. so almost every trick meant for a larger animal must be adapted to suit the needs of a guinea pig.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> When you see your crus. grab his gaze and hold it. Smile at him. Hold that look for a few seconds and then look away. Repeat it again and if he’s interested he’ll mirror your cues.


Use the flick technique: Meet his eye. let your gaze fall to his mout. and then lift them so that your eyes meet his again. Pair that with a coy grin.When you know he’s watching yo. play with your hair a little. This lets him know that you notice him noticing you.
Fake it till you make it. The more you allow yourself to relax into the situation and feel comfortable with i. the more confident you will seem. Confidence is an aphrodisiac for men so use it generously.


Don’t fidget with or hide your hands as its often a sign of nervousness. Place them on your hips or leave them out in the open to promote better posture and signal to him that you are open.
Keep your chin up and eyes level at all time. even as you walk to project confidence.
Take care of your appearance. Groom with products that leave you smelling good and feeling good: like conditioner. lotion. fragrance. etc. Pay attention to the details.
 He’ll remember you from your back and forth looks. Comment offhandedly about something in class or make a joke. This takes the pressure off an initial one-on-one encounter and can feel a lot more organic than the individual approach attempt.
 If you’re feeling brav. approach him directly. If no. make approaching him more comfortable by setting the scene. The setup will provide the icebreaker you need to get the conversation going.


Bump into him and apologize frantically. Place your hand in your hair and laugh at yourself for running into him.
Drop somethin. like a book or a pe. as you walk past him. He will either run after you to return it to you or you can retrieve it yourself and explain that you are clumsy.
 This will always be the boldest move because it’s direc. straightforwar. and lacks the presence of games. The simplest thing to say is: “H. I’m Ashle. what’s your name?”If in-person introductions intimidate yo. create an indirect approach to introducing yourself.
Add him on Facebook or Instagram. Message him directly by giving your name and telling him where he might know you from (school or work). Tell him you have noticed him from afar and have been dying to talk to him and let him know your name.
Direct message him on Twitter introducing yourself as his classmate or coworker Ashley. Use your shyness to your advantage by saying that he makes you so shy in person that Twitter messaging became the next best thing to hello.
Get his number from a mutual friend. This one is a little risky because a lot of people do not like to have their numbers handed out if it is not from them directl. but if you make up a good excus. you might be able to make this move work in your favor. Apologize for having his number and tell him that you missed notes in clas. heard he would have the. and really need it to study for an upcoming test. This looks more proactiv. less craz. so if you’re going to text hi. make sure you have a reason and take the conversation from there.
 Light topics will always be easier to expound upon into deeper topics later. Ask about the weather or ask if he went to the school’s last game. Ask him how he’s doing today or what he’s up to.


”What kind of day are you having?”
”What are you studying?”
”Where do you work?”
”What are you doing later?”

, Ask questions that are open-ended and lead to him describing his likes and dislike. his passion. and his interests. Listen to his responses more than you speak. ”What kind of movies do you like? What are your favorites?”
”What do you like to read in your spare time?”
”What is the most beautiful place you’ve ever been?”
”Where do you plan to travel to this year?”
”What’s one thing that you’re reall. really good at?”

, Men like praise and appreciation as much as women do. The act itself puts into words your interest in him. Slip into the conversation organically and limit the compliments to a couple at a time.If he smiles while you’re talking: “You have an incredible smile.”
If he laughs at something funny: “Your laugh is music.”
If he has a great sense of humor: “You are really funny.”
If you like what he’s wearing: “You have really great style.”
If you want to mention his looks but not directl. wait for him to do something that’s cut. like talking about a hobby passionately: “You’re so cute.”

, Make things feel less formal and less like an interview by making conversation a two-way street. If he asks questions about you because he’s interested and wants to know mor. answer honestly and confidently.


Connect a shared passion or interest with a personal story to deepen the emotional connection between you two.
Allow him to get to know who you are and decide if he likes what he likes.
 Stare in his eyes intensely. Use body language to show him your interest. Touch him lightly on the arm or accidentally touch his le. knee. or feet with yours.
 Now that momentum has been made with creating a foundation for friendshi. see if there’s more there by hanging out one-on-one in a more intimate setting. Connection continues to build the more you bond through shared activities.Grab a bite to eat somewhere just the two of you.
Find a less pressured date setting by going hiking or doing something active like racquetball.
Consider volunteering together to build houses or feed the hungry.

 You can just as easily share these things with someone you just recently met. Whether it's going to a resort clu. taking a long swim or watching a tropical sunset togethe. the girl will associate positive feelings with you as she shares worthwhile experiences with you.
 Here are some of the things you should keep an eye out for if you're trying to figure out if she's interested:


If she's messaging you frequently throughout the vacatio. it's a good sign that she's interested in seeing more of you.
She's likely interested in pursuing things with you if she singles you out in a crow. or spends more time with you than the party she originally came on vacation with.
Typical body language signs of attractio. like twirling hair and sustained eye contac. should also be taken into account in this instanc. although you should consider potential differences in culture. Women from certain cultures will manifest their attraction in more subtle ways than what you're used to dealing with.
 Although you shouldn't jump in the second you meet a gir. you shouldn't wait to make your feelings and intentions known to her. If you feel you've arrived at an appropriate tim. jump on the chance and see what happens.


If it turns out that the girl isn't interested in yo. you shouldn't take it to heart. Vacation romances seldom work out as it i. and any pain you feel will be lessened by the time you get back home.
 Although part of this is the impression that someone won't be judged if she's away from the people she know. it's still paramount that you approach any potential sexual encounter with safety in mind. Failing to do so could result in sexually transmitted diseases or even pregnancy.

Keep the conversation light-hearted.Even if you're looking to make a serious romance with the girl you're talking wit. you shouldn't touch upon any serious topics when you're first chatting with her.
Invite her to do something with you.You shouldn't wait long into a conversation before asking the girl to do something fun with you.
Take advantage of a vacation's excitement.Unlike a romance closer to hom. there's a much greater degree of excitement when you're out on vacation.
Share good experiences together.A vacation is meant to be a time where you get out and do things you're not familiar with.
Look for signs of attraction.As with any interaction with a woman you're interested i. you can gauge the likelihood of your success by looking at signs of attraction.
Act quickly.Vacations don't last lon. so your window of opportunity will almost always be accordingly brief.
Practice safety first.Vacationers who meet other singles are more likely to practice unsafe sexual practices than if they were back at home.</s>"

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Perhaps this is the biggest secret but reall. it's the clincher. The best way to impress a girl is to not set out to impress her. Now you might be wondering how this really works. The issue at heart is that when most guys try to impress girl. they tend to become less authentic and when this happen. they can try to show off with almost anything and everything. Girls are not impressed by such tactics and tend to end up putting you in the "show off" categor. unimpressed by the antics and bravado. The best way to impress a girl is to be yoursel. let things happen automatically and keep the show pony antics for your mates.
If you thought that girls are impressed by money and material things all the tim. then you are mistaken. The best way to impress a girl and retain your status is by the way of natural talents which involve the way you talk and present yourself. You need girls to respect you for who you are.


If the girl is impressed by your mone. then she is probably looking for money and not yo. so that's a good telltale sign to back off.
 Don't talk to her with the quest to impress rather try to do what you normally do. One of the best aspects which almost every girl demands and gets impressed by is intellectuality. Try to develop your intellectual skills. This can be done by the way to reading book. quality online articles and being up-to-date with the latest happenings. Remember that being a good talker is the foundation of impressing almost any girl.


Have something which is different from the rest. Girls normally get hit on by several men every day and almost all those men try to impress them with all they’ve got. If you are doing and following the same tactics as all those me. then you won't succeed in your quest to impress girls.
 Avoid being erotic or cras. that just scares girls off. Make it clear that you like her.


If she is insecur. anything you do to to get her attention must be positive and slow. When you take your tim. it shows her that you care enough to take it slowly.
 The way to melt a girl's heart is to show kindness and to be considerate of her needs. Notice the person she really is and compliment tha. not her look. clothes or "hotness". Actually show that you care about her by noticing her personalit. intelligenc. style and creativity.

Tell her she is pretty with no makeup and sweats with her hair in a messy bun or ponytail.
Compliment her on the care she has taken to present herself; she will feel appreciated when it's noticed.






Buy her a gif. like chocolate; it doesn't have to be special or expensiv. it's the obviousness that you were thinking about her in your free time that makes her blush.
If she is col. or just for fu. give her your sweatshirt or coat––it has your smell and she will like to wear it.
 There's nothing a girl likes more than being talked to by guy. even if there is an age difference.


Hold actual conversations with the girl and talk about the things that matter to both of yo. but let her do more of the talking to begin wit. to allow you to learn about her.
Don't tell tall stories to try to impress her. She'll see through it and you'll come across looking daft.
 Girls really want someone who will not let them down and who is a promise-keeper. If you can't do something you said you'd d. tell her the trut. don't make up stories.


Girls love a guy who cares about he. and who won't make fun of her if she's in a bad situation.
 Be playful in a fun and kind way. Also be wary of the following:


Don't make her feel awkward when she is with you.






Don't be a jerk. Girls hate it when you try to get their attention by putting other people off or making a bad comment about what someone looks like.
Don't be a horndog and make comments about "doin' it" with her; that's an immediate turnoff. Don't pressure her to do anything she doesn't don't want to do with you.
Don't brag about what you've done in intimacy with her to your mates. That's a code breaker and potentially a relationship breaker too.
 Call or contact her at least once a day when you see he. and twice when you don't. It helps her to feel special.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> People tend to use Western style riding for rodeos and ranching and it is more common in the U.S. than in other countrie. so you might have a harder time accessing Western equipment if you live somewhere that favors English style.


One nice thing about the Western saddle is that it has the hor. where you can grip onto if you're on an experienced rider.
 If this is the first time you're using this bit on this particular horse you definitely want to make sure that you're using the proper sized bridle. If it's the wrong size it will make the horse uncomfortable.Bridles comes in three sizes: pon. cob or Arabia. and full. Measure your horse’s head from the center of his poll to the corner of his mout. and compare this measurement to the crown and cheek piece of the bridle.
If the bit is too small it can pinch the horse’s mouth.
If the bit is too big it will slide around in the horse’s mouth.
 A horse can sense your fear and this will make them nervous. Als. remember that it can be nerve-wracking for a horse to have someone putting something metallic in their mouth.
 You need to make sure that your horse is secured. This means anticipating the moment when they are halter-free but you haven't yet buckle the bridle. You have to be able to control and keep hold of your horse.


For a tie statio. hold the bridle so that the front of the brow band faces forward (away from the horse). Drape the reins over their neck. Drop your left rein over the horse's neck so that it falls on the right. Drop the right rein so that it falls on the left. Allow the bridle to slip back on your arm. Lift the crown of the halter over the horse's ears and slip the halter's nose band dow. off their face. Bring the crown up and lay it behind their ears. Refasten their halter so it hands around the horse's neck.
If you don't have a tie station use the bridle reins to maintain hold of your horse. For split rein. tie them together and lift the reins over the horse's hea. setting them just behind their ears. Lift the halter's crown over the horse's ears and slip the halter nose band off your horse's face.
 You can offer them a piece of apple or sugar cube to make them their head. Put your hand right below their nose with the treat in it. When they drop their head that's when you'll put the bit in.


Make sure you’re grasping the crown of the bridle in your right hand. Angle in line with your horse’s left eye and right ear.
 Hold the bit low where you’ve been holding the treats. Gently set it against your horse’s teeth as close to where her top teeth meet her lower teeth as possible. Hold your sugar cube against the bit.

Make sure you put the bit in before you put the bridle’s crown over their ears.
Holding the crown of the bridle up in order to slip it on before you put the bit in their mouth.
Hold the bridle so that the two sides are a good distance apar. with the crown up and the throatlatch straps hanging free and not tangled in any other straps.
 You want to be careful that you don't crush your horse's ears. Lift the crown over your horse's left ear as you slip the crown to the poll. Gently slip the horse's right ear in front of the crown as well. Also gently push the horse's ears forward rather than backward.


If the bridle has earloops rather than a brow ban. position these around your horse’s ears now.
 Always make sure that you reward your horse for their good behavior. This will encourage them to be good about accepting the bit and the bridle.


Sugar also encourages them to play with the bi. so sugar cubes are a really good treat to have on hand for bridling.
, Remember that the throatlatch isn't there to hold the bridle in place. It operates as an extra precaution against the bridle coming off. This means that the throatlatch needs to be loose enough to maintain slac. even if the horse drops their head.


Make sure you can fit your entire hand between the throatlatch and the hors. even when their head is bent towards their neck.
 The brow band should be smooth and in the correct position. This means it won't be pinching your horse's ears or head. Check that the bit sits evenly in your horse's mouth. There should be two wrinkles on either corner of your horse's mouth. Too fewer and you need to shorten the cheek straps.


Make sure it sits evenly on your horse’s head. If you do have to adjust the cheek strap check that the rest of the headstall is still even.
Buckle curb chain or chin strap if that isn’t fixed.
This is when you should check the length of your reins. The need to be long enough that you can take up contact with your horse's mouth.
 Lead them on their lef. at their cheek. Hold the reins in your right hand about six inches below the bit. Keep the bight in your left hand. Always hold about six inches below the bit.


Keep the slack from the reins in your left hand.

If you want to send your guy friend the signal you want a relationshi. work on flirting with your body when the two of you are together. If he is attracted to you as wel. this can help romantic feeling develop.Tilt your body towards him when you're having lunch togethe. watching a movi. or other times when you hang out.
Look him directly in the ey. bat your eyelashes and smile.
It may sound strang. but this is a form of flirtation that gets attention! Try to position your body the way his is when you're sitting together. Place your hands and feet in the same position as his hands and feet. If you're having coffe. take a sip when he does.Pick up some his expressions. If he has a tendency to sa. "Wo. that's interestin." for exampl. use this phrase on occasion.
Don't make it too obvious. He may think you're making fun of him! Imitate his gestures on occasio. but don't copy every single thing he does.
 Being attractive certainly helps someone notice you in a more than friends sense. When hanging out with hi. dress your best. Wear your most flattering clothes an. if you wear makeu. throw some on. Looking stunning can definitely help attract someone's romantic attention.Wear clothing that makes you feel good about yourself and that you feel comfortable in. You don't have to try to look like anyone but yourself.
 If you lack self confidenc. you're less likely to come off as attractive to other people. Having a strong sense of who you are will help your guy friend notice you. Do not simply agree with what he sees and smile and nod. Show off who you are while flirting!Think about how you see yourself as a person. Do you see yourself as smar. funn. spontaneou. seriou. studious? However you see yoursel. work on showing off that side for him.
For exampl. if you're a movie buf. don't hesitate to share your knowledge while the two of you hang out and watch movies.
 It's natural to develop feelings for someone if you spend a lot of time with that person. Try to frequent the same places he does. If you know he hangs out at a local coffee sho. spend time there. Invite him out with your friends for group gatherings. Go to social events where you know you'll see him.If you go to school togethe. try to interact with him frequently at school. Talk to him between classes. Sit by him in class whenever possible. Have lunch with him.
 People want to date those who are similar to them. If you have a lot in commo. play up these similarities. Do and say things to make him notice how alike you are. For exampl. if you both like a particular directo. talk about movies by that director.Maybe both of you are really interested in science fiction books or basketball. Find your common ground and emphasize it!

, If you're genuinely intrigued by some of his interest. explore them. For instanc. you can listen to a band he likes and then chat with him about it the next day. You could even ask him to check out their concert with you.


Be yourself! Don't force yourself to be interested in things that don't appeal to you just because he likes them.
 As friend. you may already hang out alone sometimes. Work on having a little more one-on-one time with him. This will give you a chance to get flirty in order to gain his attention. If you're nervou. go to a big social event and spend some time alone with him there.For exampl. ask him to a party and then find a cozy corner where the two of you can chat.
You can also try to hang out one-on-one in casual settings. For exampl. grab a cup of coffee together after school.
 If you're having trouble getting a guy to notice yo. try touching him whenever possible. This can help him think of you in a more romantic sense. For exampl. when you're having coffee togethe. try brushing his arm slightly when you're talking. Lean into him a little while you're watching a movie together.Do something flirty and playfu. like tussling his hair.
Hug him on occasion. A cozy hug once in awhile can eventually lead to more.
 Many people feel more comfortable transitioning into dating gradually. Try asking him what he's doing this weekend an. when he respond. suggest something the two of you could do together instead. For exampl. "Bowling sounds fun this weeken. but I have tickets to this concert if you want to go with me."Try asking him for advice on somewhere to g. and then ask him to go with you. For exampl. say: "Where do you get good pizza in this town?"
When he answer. say something lik. "O. cool. He. since you like that plac. maybe we could go together."

, If he's not getting the hin. don't be afraid to make the first move! Many guys actually appreciate when a potential romantic partner makes the move for them. Guys are shy to. so don't be afraid to make the first move.Remembe. this guy is your friend. This can help take some pressure off.
A friend is more likely to be polite and let you down eas. as well.
 When asking him ou. go at your own pace. Rushing through things can make you look nervou. making you both feel anxious in the situation. You want to start things off in a good plac. so slowly work your way up to asking him out when the time comes.Do not rush through your words. When the two of you do interact one-on-on. allow conversation to happen naturally for a bit before making your move.
If you're feeling nervou. take a few deep breaths to calm yourself.
 If indirect invitations aren't workin. it's time to be bold about your feelings. Simply say something lik. "S. I feel a strong romantic connection with you. Would you like to go out on a date some time?" You want to proceed with your relationshi. friendship or otherwis. with no confusion.While this may feel very bol. many people appreciate it when you're straightforward.
You can also emphasize how important his friendship is to you. You could say something lik. “I really do love being your friend and if you aren’t into me in a romantic wa. I just want you to know that I am happy with just being friends. Nothing about our friendship will change. I want to continue having fun with you and being your friend.”

, Even if you've done everything "righ." there's still a chance your guy friend just won't see you in that way. Remember this hurt will fade with time. While it seems like the end of the world no. you will eventually get over these feelings. Everyone gets rejected at some poin. so don’t let it affect your confidence. Beside. even if he doesn’t feel romantically about you no. that doesn’t mean he’ll always feel that way. Stay positive! No matter what happen. it doesn't reflect negatively on you as a person. You are awesom. with or without him!

For exampl. maybe you like that you are a loyal friend or maybe you like that you are kind to people. Write down the great qualities that you have and focus on these.
Don’t take it personally. Your crush's rejection likely has nothing to do with you. Your crush not having feelings for you is not a statement about you; it’s a statement about them. You are a perfectly lovely person who simply wasn’t meant to be with your crush.
There are so many reasons that your crush might not be intereste. and almost none of them have to do with you. Maybe your crush wasn’t ready for a relationship. Maybe they don’t have time right now. Maybe they don’t want to make a commitment to someone. Maybe they have feelings for someone else. Don’t question yourself. It’s their loss.
Make a list of everything else in your lif. such as the peopl. activitie. and interests that you have. This will help you to see yourself more clearly and not let one person’s rejection be blown out of proportion.


Don’t let your crush's rejection define you. There are so many other important aspects of your life. All of these things that make you happy help define who you are. You are the same wonderful person whether someone notices it or not. Your worth is never dependent on any other person. Seeing all of these other great parts of your life will help you to put one person's rejection in perspective. There are over seven billion people on our planet. So one of them didn’t like you. That’s ok! That one person might have felt like the whole world to yo. but they are simply one of many. There are probably millions of people who have similar characteristics as your crush. Now that you know what kind of person you are looking fo. you can open your eyes to all the other wonderful people out there.Over your lifetim. there will likely be many people who you like and many who like you. Sometimes you will like someone and they won’t like you back. Sometimes someone will like you and you won’t like them back. Sometimes you both won’t like each other. And every once in a while you will find someone who likes you as much as you like them. This is to be expected. This is what happens when there are so many different people in the world.
