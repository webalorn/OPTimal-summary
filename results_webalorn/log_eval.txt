[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> It not only captures their attention but also makes it easier for you to start a conversation. You may also have a higher chance of being paired up together, and you can discuss assignments and tests with them. You'll also be able to comment on what they say without looking weird.
 There are a variety of different topics that you can talk about, but you can mostly focus on the ones that your crush is interested in. Try to come up with a new subject every time you talk to them. That way, they'll see you as an interesting, fun person and perhaps look forward to your conversations. You could also try asking them for help with a task, even if you don't need assistance. As long as it's believable, it should work as long as you don't do this too frequently. However, be sure that you show that you're intelligent. For instance, if you're a math whiz, don't ask your crush questions related to math.
 You could also your crush about an assignment, which may open the way up to other subjects. Even if you're not in the same class, ask your crush about their lessons or what homework they have. However, be sure to talk about other topics so that you don't exhaust the current one.
 In order to show them that you care, lend them pencils, paper, or any other supplies that they may need. Allow them to cry on your shoulder if something bad happens to them, and show them that you are a kind person. Be sure that you don't overdo it; otherwise, they may take advantage of your generosity.
 A simple "hello" might lead to a conversation. Even if you don't have time to talk to them, quickly greet them to show that you're thinking of them. It may also grab their attention and cause them to think of you.
 Add your crush to Facebook or other social networks you're both on. This is especially recommended if you both have mutual friends. This can lead the way to conversations outside of school, and you may be invited to events.
 Now that you're talking to your crush, subtly flirt with them. This will help you get a sense of how interested they are in you, and you'll also show that you're attracted to them. If you get a positive response, continue flirting a bit and slowly increase it. However, if you feel that they aren't interested, tone it down a bit.
 Although you may be attracted to them, you need to focus on your own life. They are just a person, and if they don't show interest, move on. No person is worth that much effort.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> You and your guinea pig will not reach the harder stuff without knowing everything that you should know about training first. First, work on targeting, conditioning your pig to the clicker, and doing simple tricks, such as "Stand Up".
 Just because a trick doesn't necessarily exist doesn't mean you can't teach it to your piggy anyway. Make up your own tricks, use your mind, and have fun with it! If you are both bored out of your minds, there is no point in training at all.


Make very low hurdles-no more than two inches off the ground at the most-and teach your guinea pig to jump over them, create a safe agility course, or use lures to train your piggy to jump through a hoop. The possibilities are endless!

, I've said it once, I'll say it again; guinea pigs are much more fragile than the average dog or cat, so almost every trick meant for a larger animal must be adapted to suit the needs of a guinea pig.


Ensure that there is nothing to endanger your piggy before, during, or after training, or any other time. Take every needed safety precaution every time.
 While taking a guinea pig to shows to be judged by their fur color, pattern, and sleekness is not exactly everyone's cup of tea, it may be an option to do things with your guinea pig that involve training, showing off tricks, and meeting fellow guinea pig lovers. Summary: "

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> When you see your crush, grab his gaze and hold it. Smile at him. Hold that look for a few seconds and then look away. Repeat it again and if he‚Äôs interested he‚Äôll mirror your cues.


Use the flick technique: Meet his eyes, let your gaze fall to his mouth, and then lift them so that your eyes meet his again. Pair that with a coy grin.When you know he‚Äôs watching you, play with your hair a little. This lets him know that you notice him noticing you.
Fake it till you make it. The more you allow yourself to relax into the situation and feel comfortable with it, the more confident you will seem. Confidence is an aphrodisiac for men so use it generously.


Don‚Äôt fidget with or hide your hands as its often a sign of nervousness. Place them on your hips or leave them out in the open to promote better posture and signal to him that you are open.
Keep your chin up and eyes level at all times, even as you walk to project confidence.
Take care of your appearance. Groom with products that leave you smelling good and feeling good: like conditioners, lotions, fragrances, etc. Pay attention to the details.
 He‚Äôll remember you from your back and forth looks. Comment offhandedly about something in class or make a joke. This takes the pressure off an initial one-on-one encounter and can feel a lot more organic than the individual approach attempt.
 If you‚Äôre feeling brave, approach him directly. If not, make approaching him more comfortable by setting the scene. The setup will provide the icebreaker you need to get the conversation going.


Bump into him and apologize frantically. Place your hand in your hair and laugh at yourself for running into him.
Drop something, like a book or a pen, as you walk past him. He will either run after you to return it to you or you can retrieve it yourself and explain that you are clumsy.
 This will always be the boldest move because it‚Äôs direct, straightforward, and lacks the presence of games. The simplest thing to say is: ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Ashley, what‚Äôs your name?‚ÄùIf in-person introductions intimidate you, create an indirect approach to introducing yourself.
Add him on Facebook or Instagram. Message him directly by giving your name and telling him where he might know you from (school or work). Tell him you have noticed him from afar and have been dying to talk to him and let him know your name.
Direct message him on Twitter introducing yourself as his classmate or coworker Ashley. Use your shyness to your advantage by saying that he makes you so shy in person that Twitter messaging became the next best thing to hello.
Get his number from a mutual friend. This one is a little risky because a lot of people do not like to have their numbers handed out if it is not from them directly, but if you make up a good excuse, you might be able to make this move work in your favor. Apologize for having his number and tell him that you missed notes in class, heard he would have them, and really need it to study for an upcoming test. This looks more proactive, less crazy, so if you‚Äôre going to text him, make sure you have a reason and take the conversation from there.
 Light topics will always be easier to expound upon into deeper topics later. Ask about the weather or ask if he went to the school‚Äôs last game. Ask him how he‚Äôs doing today or what he‚Äôs up to.


‚ÄùWhat kind of day are you having?‚Äù
‚ÄùWhat are you studying?‚Äù
‚ÄùWhere do you work?‚Äù
‚ÄùWhat are you doing later?‚Äù

‚ÄùWhat do you like to read in your spare time?‚Äù
‚ÄùWhat is the most beautiful place you‚Äôve ever been?‚Äù
‚ÄùWhere do you plan to travel to this year?‚Äù
‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs one thing that you‚Äôre really, really good at?‚Äù

, Men like praise and appreciation as much as women do. The act itself puts into words your interest in him. Slip into the conversation organically and limit the compliments to a couple at a time.If he smiles while you‚Äôre talking: ‚ÄúYou have an incredible smile.‚Äù
If he laughs at something funny: ‚ÄúYour laugh is music.‚Äù
If he has a great sense of humor: ‚ÄúYou are really funny.‚Äù
If you like what he‚Äôs wearing: ‚ÄúYou have really great style.‚Äù
If you want to mention his looks but not directly, wait for him to do something that‚Äôs cute, like talking about a hobby passionately: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so cute.‚Äù

, Make things feel less formal and less like an interview by making conversation a two-way street. If he asks questions about you because he‚Äôs interested and wants to know more, answer honestly and confidently.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> One of the major causes of falling too hard for a guy is seeing him as flawless. Remind yourself that no one is flawless. Instead of choosing to ignore his shortcomings, figure them out and think about whether or not you can accept them. If you avoid this and end up in a relationship with him, his inability to maintain the perfect image you created for him will damage the relationship.Try having a conversation about weaknesses. He probably knows his flaws best, and learning this information from him might help to ground you. Tell him your weaknesses too so that he doesn‚Äôt assume that you‚Äôre perfect either.
 When you‚Äôre in the giddy early phase of getting to know a romantic interest, you can be blind to the reality of relationships. Look back briefly on past experiences that didn‚Äôt quite work out in your favor. Consider the fact that some of those hard times could happen with this new guy that you like. Ask yourself if you're willing to go through that pain again. Ask yourself if you see the potential for any of those problems to come up again. When you‚Äôre really starting to develop feelings, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to stay true to who you are. You might be acting a certain way that appeals to him in order to speed up the relationship‚Äôs development. While this might get his interest in the short term, it‚Äôll eliminate the possibility of a healthy relationship later. Be honest about the fact that you love rap music even if you know he only listens to country.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Keep the conversation light and fun.


If in doubt, ask questions about her. Ask her where she's from, who's she on vacation with, and what sort of things she's seen since she got here. All of these questions can lead to positive conversations.
 If you're out on vacation, there should be a wide range of activities available to you. Whether it's swimming, hiking, partying or seeing a show, you should keep the activities on-the-go and exciting.


When one activity ends, start up another. This will show the girl that you are fun and spontaneous.
 If you're looking to meet a woman abroad, you should take advantage of this excitement. This is especially true if the woman is out vacationing herself. While you interact with her, don't hesitate or be afraid of potentially making a fool of yourself. Because you may only know this girl for a short amount of time, there are far fewer repercussions than if you were approaching someone domestically.
 You can just as easily share these things with someone you just recently met. Whether it's going to a resort club, taking a long swim or watching a tropical sunset together, the girl will associate positive feelings with you as she shares worthwhile experiences with you.
 Here are some of the things you should keep an eye out for if you're trying to figure out if she's interested:


If she's messaging you frequently throughout the vacation, it's a good sign that she's interested in seeing more of you.
She's likely interested in pursuing things with you if she singles you out in a crowd, or spends more time with you than the party she originally came on vacation with.
Typical body language signs of attraction, like twirling hair and sustained eye contact, should also be taken into account in this instance, although you should consider potential differences in culture. Women from certain cultures will manifest their attraction in more subtle ways than what you're used to dealing with.
 Although you shouldn't jump in the second you meet a girl, you shouldn't wait to make your feelings and intentions known to her. If you feel you've arrived at an appropriate time, jump on the chance and see what happens.


If it turns out that the girl isn't interested in you, you shouldn't take it to heart. Vacation romances seldom work out as it is, and any pain you feel will be lessened by the time you get back home.
 Although part of this is the impression that someone won't be judged if she's away from the people she knows, it's still paramount that you approach any potential sexual encounter with safety in mind. Failing to do so could result in sexually transmitted diseases or even pregnancy.

 Summary: "
[92mWanted summary:[0m "
Keep the conversation light-hearted.Even if you're looking to make a serious romance with the girl you're talking with, you shouldn't touch upon any serious topics when you're first chatting with her.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Perhaps this is the biggest secret but really, it's the clincher. The best way to impress a girl is to not set out to impress her. Now you might be wondering how this really works. The issue at heart is that when most guys try to impress girls, they tend to become less authentic and when this happens, they can try to show off with almost anything and everything. Girls are not impressed by such tactics and tend to end up putting you in the "show off" category, unimpressed by the antics and bravado. The best way to impress a girl is to be yourself, let things happen automatically and keep the show pony antics for your mates.
If you thought that girls are impressed by money and material things all the time, then you are mistaken. The best way to impress a girl and retain your status is by the way of natural talents which involve the way you talk and present yourself. You need girls to respect you for who you are.


If the girl is impressed by your money, then she is probably looking for money and not you, so that's a good telltale sign to back off.
 Don't talk to her with the quest to impress rather try to do what you normally do. One of the best aspects which almost every girl demands and gets impressed by is intellectuality. Try to develop your intellectual skills. This can be done by the way to reading books, quality online articles and being up-to-date with the latest happenings. Remember that being a good talker is the foundation of impressing almost any girl.


Have something which is different from the rest. Girls normally get hit on by several men every day and almost all those men try to impress them with all they‚Äôve got. If you are doing and following the same tactics as all those men, then you won't succeed in your quest to impress girls.
 Avoid being erotic or crass, that just scares girls off. Make it clear that you like her.


If she is insecure, anything you do to to get her attention must be positive and slow. When you take your time, it shows her that you care enough to take it slowly.
 The way to melt a girl's heart is to show kindness and to be considerate of her needs. Notice the person she really is and compliment that, not her looks, clothes or "hotness". Actually show that you care about her by noticing her personality, intelligence, style and creativity.

Tell her she is pretty with no makeup and sweats with her hair in a messy bun or ponytail.
Compliment her on the care she has taken to present herself; she will feel appreciated when it's noticed.






Buy her a gift, like chocolate; it doesn't have to be special or expensive, it's the obviousness that you were thinking about her in your free time that makes her blush.
If she is cold, or just for fun, give her your sweatshirt or coat‚Äì‚Äìit has your smell and she will like to wear it.
 There's nothing a girl likes more than being talked to by guys, even if there is an age difference.


Hold actual conversations with the girl and talk about the things that matter to both of you, but let her do more of the talking to begin with, to allow you to learn about her.
Don't tell tall stories to try to impress her. She'll see through it and you'll come across looking daft.
 Girls really want someone who will not let them down and who is a promise-keeper. If you can't do something you said you'd do, tell her the truth, don't make up stories.


Girls love a guy who cares about her, and who won't make fun of her if she's in a bad situation.
 Be playful in a fun and kind way. Also be wary of the following:


Don't make her feel awkward when she is with you.






Don't be a jerk. Girls hate it when you try to get their attention by putting other people off or making a bad comment about what someone looks like.
Don't be a horndog and make comments about "doin' it" with her; that's an immediate turnoff. Don't pressure her to do anything she doesn't don't want to do with you.
Don't brag about what you've done in intimacy with her to your mates. That's a code breaker and potentially a relationship breaker too.
 Call or contact her at least once a day when you see her, and twice when you don't. It helps her to feel special.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> People tend to use Western style riding for rodeos and ranching and it is more common in the U.S. than in other countries, so you might have a harder time accessing Western equipment if you live somewhere that favors English style.


One nice thing about the Western saddle is that it has the horn, where you can grip onto if you're on an experienced rider.
 If this is the first time you're using this bit on this particular horse you definitely want to make sure that you're using the proper sized bridle. If it's the wrong size it will make the horse uncomfortable.Bridles comes in three sizes: pony, cob or Arabian, and full. Measure your horse‚Äôs head from the center of his poll to the corner of his mouth, and compare this measurement to the crown and cheek piece of the bridle.
If the bit is too small it can pinch the horse‚Äôs mouth.
If the bit is too big it will slide around in the horse‚Äôs mouth.
 A horse can sense your fear and this will make them nervous. Also, remember that it can be nerve-wracking for a horse to have someone putting something metallic in their mouth.
 You need to make sure that your horse is secured. This means anticipating the moment when they are halter-free but you haven't yet buckle the bridle. You have to be able to control and keep hold of your horse.


For a tie station, hold the bridle so that the front of the brow band faces forward (away from the horse). Drape the reins over their neck. Drop your left rein over the horse's neck so that it falls on the right. Drop the right rein so that it falls on the left. Allow the bridle to slip back on your arm. Lift the crown of the halter over the horse's ears and slip the halter's nose band down, off their face. Bring the crown up and lay it behind their ears. Refasten their halter so it hands around the horse's neck.
If you don't have a tie station use the bridle reins to maintain hold of your horse. For split reins, tie them together and lift the reins over the horse's head, setting them just behind their ears. Lift the halter's crown over the horse's ears and slip the halter nose band off your horse's face.
 You can offer them a piece of apple or sugar cube to make them their head. Put your hand right below their nose with the treat in it. When they drop their head that's when you'll put the bit in.


Make sure you‚Äôre grasping the crown of the bridle in your right hand. Angle in line with your horse‚Äôs left eye and right ear.
 Hold the bit low where you‚Äôve been holding the treats. Gently set it against your horse‚Äôs teeth as close to where her top teeth meet her lower teeth as possible. Hold your sugar cube against the bit.

Make sure you put the bit in before you put the bridle‚Äôs crown over their ears.
Holding the crown of the bridle up in order to slip it on before you put the bit in their mouth.
Hold the bridle so that the two sides are a good distance apart, with the crown up and the throatlatch straps hanging free and not tangled in any other straps.
 You want to be careful that you don't crush your horse's ears. Lift the crown over your horse's left ear as you slip the crown to the poll. Gently slip the horse's right ear in front of the crown as well. Also gently push the horse's ears forward rather than backward.


If the bridle has earloops rather than a brow band, position these around your horse‚Äôs ears now.
 Always make sure that you reward your horse for their good behavior. This will encourage them to be good about accepting the bit and the bridle.


Sugar also encourages them to play with the bit, so sugar cubes are a really good treat to have on hand for bridling.
, Remember that the throatlatch isn't there to hold the bridle in place. It operates as an extra precaution against the bridle coming off. This means that the throatlatch needs to be loose enough to maintain slack, even if the horse drops their head.


Make sure you can fit your entire hand between the throatlatch and the horse, even when their head is bent towards their neck.
 The brow band should be smooth and in the correct position. This means it won't be pinching your horse's ears or head. Check that the bit sits evenly in your horse's mouth. There should be two wrinkles on either corner of your horse's mouth. Too fewer and you need to shorten the cheek straps.


Make sure it sits evenly on your horse‚Äôs head. If you do have to adjust the cheek strap check that the rest of the headstall is still even.
Buckle curb chain or chin strap if that isn‚Äôt fixed.
This is when you should check the length of your reins. The need to be long enough that you can take up contact with your horse's mouth.
 Lead them on their left, at their cheek. Hold the reins in your right hand about six inches below the bit. Keep the bight in your left hand. Always hold about six inches below the bit.


Keep the slack from the reins in your left hand.

Look him directly in the eye, bat your eyelashes and smile!;
, It may sound strange, but this is a form of flirtation that gets attention! Try to position your body the way his is when you're sitting together. Place your hands and feet in the same position as his hands and feet. If you're having coffee, take a sip when he does.Pick up some his expressions. If he has a tendency to say, "Wow, that's interesting," for example, use this phrase on occasion.
Don't make it too obvious. He may think you're making fun of him! Imitate his gestures on occasion, but don't copy every single thing he does.
 Being attractive certainly helps someone notice you in a more than friends sense. When hanging out with him, dress your best. Wear your most flattering clothes and, if you wear makeup, throw some on. Looking stunning can definitely help attract someone's romantic attention.Wear clothing that makes you feel good about yourself and that you feel comfortable in.

 If you lack self confidence, you're less likely to come off as attractive to other people. Having a strong sense of who you are will help your guy friend notice you. Do not simply agree with what he sees and smile and nod. Show off who you are while flirting!Think about how you see yourself as a person. Do you see yourself as smart, funny, spontaneous, serious, studious? However you see yourself, work on showing off that side for him.
For example, if you're a movie buff, don't hesitate to share your knowledge while the two of you hang out and watch movies.
 It's natural to develop feelings for someone if you spend a lot of time with that person. Try to frequent the same places he does. If you know he hangs out at a local coffee shop, spend time there. Invite him out with your friends for group gatherings. Go to social events where you know you'll see him.If you go to school together, try to interact with him frequently at school. Talk to him between classes. Sit by him in class whenever possible. Have lunch with him.
 People want to date those who are similar to them. If you have a lot in common, play up these similarities. Do and say things to make him notice how alike you are. For example, if you both like a particular director, talk about movies by that director.Maybe both of you are really interested in science fiction books or basketball. Find your common ground and emphasize it!

, If you're genuinely intrigued by some of his interests, explore them. For instance, you can listen to a band he likes and then chat with him about it the next day. You could even ask him to check out their concert with you.


Be yourself! Don't force yourself to be interested in things that don't appeal to you just because he likes them.
 As friends, you may already hang out alone sometimes. Work on having a little more one-on-one time with him. This will give you a chance to get flirty in order to gain his attention. If you're nervous, go to a big social event and spend some time alone with him there.For example, ask him to a party and then find a cozy corner where the two of you can chat.
You can also try to hang out one-on-one in casual settings. For example, grab a cup of coffee together after school.
 If you're having trouble getting a guy to notice you, try touching him whenever possible. This can help him think of you in a more romantic sense. For example, when you're having coffee together, try brushing his arm slightly when you're talking. Lean into him a little while you're watching a movie together.Do something flirty and playful, like tussling his hair.
Hug him on occasion. A cozy hug once in awhile can eventually lead to more.
 Many people feel more comfortable transitioning into dating gradually. Try asking him what he's doing this weekend and, when he responds, suggest something the two of you could do together instead. For example, "Bowling sounds fun this weekend, but I have tickets to this concert if you want to go with me."Try asking him for advice on somewhere to go, and then ask him to go with you. For example, say: "Where do you get good pizza in this town?"
When he answers, say something like, "Oh, cool. Hey, since you like that place, maybe we could go together."

, If he's not getting the hint, don't be afraid to make the first move! Many guys actually appreciate when a potential romantic partner makes the move for them. Guys are shy too, so don't be afraid to make the first move.Remember, this guy is your friend. This can help take some pressure off.
A friend is more likely to be polite and let you down easy, as well.
 When asking him out, go at your own pace. Rushing through things can make you look nervous, making you both feel anxious in the situation. You want to start things off in a good place, so slowly work your way up to asking him out when the time comes.Do not rush through your words. When the two of you do interact one-on-one, allow conversation to happen naturally for a bit before making your move.
If you're feeling nervous, take a few deep breaths to calm yourself.
 If indirect invitations aren't working, it's time to be bold about your feelings. Simply say something like, "So, I feel a strong romantic connection with you. Would you like to go out on a date some time?" You want to proceed with your relationship, friendship or otherwise, with no confusion.While this may feel very bold, many people appreciate it when you're straightforward.
You can also emphasize how important his friendship is to you. You could say something like, ‚ÄúI really do love being your friend and if you aren‚Äôt into me in a romantic way, I just want you to know that I am happy with just being friends. Nothing about our friendship will change. I want to continue having fun with you and being your friend.‚Äù

, Even if you've done everything "right," there's still a chance your guy friend just won't see you in that way. Remember this hurt will fade with time. While it seems like the end of the world now, you will eventually get over these feelings. Everyone gets rejected at some point, so don‚Äôt let it affect your confidence. Besides, even if he doesn‚Äôt feel romantically about you now, that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôll always feel that way. Stay positive! No matter what happens, it doesn't reflect negatively on you as a person. You are awesome, with or without him!

Make a list of your favorite things about yourself and spend time nurturing these traits. That way, if someone else doesn‚Äôt appreciate you, it won‚Äôt seem so important because you know and appreciate yourself.


For example, maybe you like that you are a loyal friend or maybe you like that you are kind to people. Write down the great qualities that you have and focus on these.
Don‚Äôt take it personally. Your crush's rejection likely has nothing to do with you. Your crush not having feelings for you is not a statement about you; it‚Äôs a statement about them. You are a perfectly lovely person who simply wasn‚Äôt meant to be with your crush.
There are so many reasons that your crush might not be interested, and almost none of them have to do with you. Maybe your crush wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. Maybe they don‚Äôt have time right now. Maybe they don‚Äôt want to make a commitment to someone. Maybe they have feelings for someone else. Don‚Äôt question yourself. It‚Äôs their loss!;
, Make a list of everything else in your life, such as the people, activities, and interests that you have. This will help you to see yourself more clearly and not let one person‚Äôs rejection be blown out of proportion.


Don‚Äôt let your crush's rejection define you. There are so many other important aspects of your life. All of these things that make you happy help define who you are. You are the same wonderful person whether someone notices it or not. Your worth is never dependent on any other person. Seeing all of these other great parts of your life will help you to put one person's rejection in perspective. There are over seven billion people on our planet. So one of them didn‚Äôt like you. That‚Äôs ok! That one person might have felt like the whole world to you, but they are simply one of many. There are probably millions of people who have similar characteristics as your crush. Now that you know what kind of person you are looking for, you can open your eyes to all the other wonderful people out there.Over your lifetime, there will likely be many people who you like and many who like you. Sometimes you will like someone and they won‚Äôt like you back. Sometimes someone will like you and you won‚Äôt like them back. Sometimes you both won‚Äôt like each other. And every once in a while you will find someone who likes you as much as you like them. This is to be expected. This is what happens when there are so many different people in the world. Think of it as an adventure and journey to finding the right person rather than a form of rejection.

Non-starchy root vegetables and leafy greens are great for your hamster. Try carrots, squash, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, lettuce, and spinach. Always wash any produce before serving it to your hamster.In terms of fruit, go for apples, pears, bananas, and berries. Provide your hamster only small servings of fruit. Never give a hamster citrus fruit, like lemons or oranges. They can be toxic to hamsters. In addition to fruits and vegetables, hamsters need the healthy fats found in seeds and nuts. Add things like sunflower seeds, cashews, almonds, and mixes of various seeds and nuts to your hamster's diet.Hamsters tend to eat nuts and seeds fast because they're drawn to fattier foods. You may be tempted to give your hamster more sunflower seeds because he seems to like them, but seeds are higher calorie in content. Stick to feeding your hamster nuts in moderation and do not feed him more simply because he finishes a serving. If you choose a high-quality hamster food, your hamster should get all the vitamins and nutrients he needs. However, many hamster owners grind up vitamins and mix them into their hamster's food. This might help your hamster have better overall health. If you're concerned about your hamster getting all his necessary nutrients, look for vitamin, mineral, and calcium supplements safe for rodents at your local pet store. Summary: "

Allow the hamster a few minutes to roll around in the sand. Use a soft brush or clean Hold the hamster in one hand, or let a helper hold them rag.

 Clean the dish out thoroughly with water, and towel dry it to make sure it‚Äôs completely dry before a later use.Use a fresh batch of dust or sand each time

, If brushing and bathing doesn‚Äôt improve your long haired hamster‚Äôs fur then you may resort to trimming. Avoid holding the hamster on its back while you do this. Keep it held in your hand or the hand of a helper. Use a small pair of scissors to trim just a little at a time from the matted fur.Trimming may even be preferable to the hamster
Feed the hamster a small piece of fruit or vegetable to keep it calm during the process.
 Get a shampoo specifically designed for hamsters or small pets from a pet store or pet aisle. Set some towels around to protect against splashing.Make sure you‚Äôre in an area you don‚Äôt mind getting wet like a sink or basin.
Wet baths are usually not a great idea for hamster‚Äôs as they can remove essential oils from the hamster‚Äôs coat.
 Use a soft grooming brush. Hold the hamster in one hand, or let a helper hold them. Pour a little of the shampoo onto the brush with some warm water. Work it into the hamster‚Äôs fur with brief light stokes.Avoid the eyes, mouth, and ears.
 Use a soft towel. You can cradle the hamster in the towel as long as the hamster has support, and feels safe. Make sure to gently pad down all of the hamster‚Äôs fur so it‚Äôs dry. Don‚Äôt be so rough you scrape the skin.If the hamster seems to be panicking or squirming then revert to the single hand-held method.
 Check for drafts. You want to make sure the hamster is not exposed to any cold air vents, wind, fans, or anything else that might make it cold while wet. You need to leave it in this warm place until its fur is completely dry.You might want to leave some rags, treats, and toys for the hamster to have while it waits.
 Use a pair of small human nail clippers or nail clippers designed for a pet such as a cat. Hold the hamster in one hand or the hand of a helper and clip the lower tips of the nails. You want to take extra care not to clip too far up the nail and risk clipping a blood vessel. If you trim the ‚Äúquick‚Äù or blood vessel then you can use some baking soda on the area to help stop the bleeding.Usually a hamster wears down their toenails through digging and climbing, but if the nails are growing so long they harm the hamster‚Äôs ability to walk or function then you can try trimming them.
 Remove the hamster to a temporary holding area like a shoebox. Completely remove all bedding from the main cage into a trash bag or similar disposable container. Thoroughly cleanse the cage with water, and dry it with towels or paper towels. Once try replace the bedding with a less entangling material.Tangles can occur with paper bedding too, but this might be a slightly better option. Consider sawdust as a bedding material.
 You can buy chew toys from a pet store. You can also improvise some gnawing elements for the hamster by putting in a small piece of untreated wood or tiny untreated branch from a hardwood tree. These all need to be pesticide free. Hamster teeth, like that of other small rodents, grow continuously. Hamsters need something to gnaw on to keep their teeth at a comfortable length.
Trees that tend have good wood for hamsters to chew include aspen, oak, apple, and cherry.
 Do short cleaning sessions especially with the brush and bathing techniques first.

Hamsters move around in their cage frequently and like to chew on wood chips and toys. Hamsters are naturally nocturnal, but tend to adapt to your schedule with time. If you've had your hamster for awhile, you can expect to see him awake when you're awake. A hamster's breathing patterns should be even and clear.If your hamster seem lethargic, sleeps a lot, or if his breathing sounds labored you should take him to a vet.
 Hamsters can develop diabetes. Increased water consumption is a common early sign. Keep an eye on how much your hamster is drinking and, if he seems to be consuming more water than usual, take him in for a check up.


Hamsters drink different levels of water depending on size and breed. However, try to keep track of how much you refill a hamster's water bowl on an average day or week. If you suddenly seem to be refilling the bowl more, you should have your hamster tested for diabetes.There is no cure for diabetes in hamsters. However, changes to a hamster's diet can help improve symptoms. If your hamster does have diabetes, you should go over a treatment plan with your veterinarian. Hamster's urine should be clear or yellow. If you notice brown or reddish urine, this could be a sign of a variety of problems. It may be something benign, like an effect of the pellets you're using. However, your hamster could also have a urinary infection or bladder stones. Red urine should be evaluated by a veterinarian as soon as possible.
 Older hamsters sometimes suffer strokes. However, strokes can happen at any age. They usually occur at night and your hamster may be still and have trouble walking and running when in the morning. Other sudden changes in movement could indicate other health problems.


If your hamster is having trouble eating or drinking, he may have suffered a stroke or have another health condition that affects his movement. Have him evaluated by a veterinarian.
In rare cases, a hamster might suffer chronic seizures. Your hamster might move his arms and legs uncontrollably while his mouth is opened. He will stare blankly with his eyes looking dull and unfocused. Seizures are a hereditary condition for which there is no cure. However, you can adjust your hamster's cage, food, and water for his safety and comfort. Hamsters who have seizures can live relatively normal life spans.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Healthy guinea pigs are very active during the day and evening. They love to play and need frequent exercise.Heatstroke, however, can make a guinea pig feel very weak. If your guinea pig has heatstroke, his legs will become weak. He will be unable or unwilling to move.If your guinea pig is able to walk, he may stagger around. In addition, his muscles may start to tremor.With heatstroke, your guinea will stop playing and running around.
When healthy, your guinea pig will quietly breathe about 80 times a minute.This sounds fast, but it is normal. If he has heatstroke, you will see him panting and struggling to breathe.His panting will get faster as his heatstroke worsens.He may start breathing very heavily‚Äîyou may see his whole body move as he tries to breathe. Heatstroke can cause guinea pigs to drool, which is not normal guinea pig behavior. Also, his saliva may look thick or feel sticky, rather than feel fairly thin. If your guinea pig will let you, look in his mouth‚Äîhis tongue will be bright red.His tongue should be pink.


His gums, which should also be pink, may look very pale or red. Normally, if you touch your guinea pig, you will feel his natural body heat. However, if he‚Äôs suffering from heatstroke, he may actually feel hot to the touch. Gently touch your guinea pig to see how warm he is. His ears, in particular, will feel very hot.An increased heart rate is common in guinea pigs with heatstroke.Be aware, though, that the heart of a healthy guinea pig beats over 200 times a minute.You can try to touch his chest to feel his heart beat, but it will probably be hard to tell that it‚Äôs beating faster than usual.
 Heatstroke can make your guinea pig physically ill. He may start vomiting or have diarrhea.As long as he is healthy and eating a normal diet, he should not vomit or have diarrhea.


Normal feces look like soft, dark pellets. If your guinea pig has diarrhea, his feces may be watery and less formed.
 Guinea pigs, despite being very active, are usually not restless. On a normal day, your guinea pig will keep himself busy by moving from one activity to another, enjoying each activity. If he has heatstroke, though, he may be restless and agitated.It will look like he just can‚Äôt make up his mind with what he wants to do.
 Heatstroke can cause seizures in guinea pigs. During a seizure, your guinea pig would fall to one side and experience muscle spasms and fast eye twitching.The eye twitching may last for several minutes. You may hear your guinea pig squeal or screech during the seizure.Seizures are not very common in guinea pigs. With handling and quality time together, your guinea pig will recognize your voice and respond to you. If he has severe heatstroke, though, he may fall into a coma, lose consciousness, and not respond to you.Try touching him and speaking to him. Even if he is weak and feeling really sick, he may still be alert enough to respond to you.
 When your guinea pig is suffering from heat stroke, act quickly! The sooner you help him, the better his chances of recovering. Move him out of the heat and take him inside to a cool area. Call your vet right away to let them know your guinea pig needs immediate help.The shade can get hot, so do not simply move your guinea pig to a shaded area outside.
 Before going to your vet‚Äôs office, start cooling down your guinea pig at home. Fill a bowl or sink with about 4 cm of lukewarm water and gently place your guinea pig in the water. Scoop some water up in your hands and gently get him wet. Do not use cold water‚Äîthe cold water would lower his body temperature too quickly and cause him to go into shock.Along with his fur and feet, make sure you get his ears wet.If your guinea pig cannot stand on his own, gently hold him upright in the water.
Rather than put your guinea pig in water, you could spray his fur with tepid water, then fan him. When your guinea pig‚Äôs body doesn‚Äôt feel so hot to the touch, place him on a clean, damp towel and take him to your vet. Turn on the car‚Äôs air conditioning to keep him cool. Rolling down the windows is also an option, but may let a lot of hot air into the car. Once you get to your vet‚Äôs office, your vet will take immediate action to cool your guinea pig.

You can skip this step if you are just writing a biology paper at university.
Female tigers are not sexually mature until they are around 3 or 4 years of age, but usually come into season around 2 1/2 years of age. She is leaving her scent marks via strong pheromones in her urine so that male tigers know that she has gone into oestrus.
The tigress will become vocal. She will roar (which tigers do not do that often) in order to attract a mate. Tigers live far away from one another, so roaring is a signal to come nearer. "Vocalisations can be persistent and one female was recorded as roaring 69 times in only 15 minutes."She will not be averse to visiting male tigers. Although usually loners, tigers drop such reserve at mating time. A male tiger's territory usually covers that of several females and although the initial meeting might result in a fight, once they have checked each other out, the mating begins.
 Given the sad reality that there are fewer and fewer tigers in the world yearly, oestrus may come and go before the female finds a male to mate with. If she does find one, and all going well they get along, the female tiger will adopt the lordosis position for mating and the male tiger will mount her, bite the back of her neck and mate. This process causes pain to the female tiger, which stimulates ovulation.

Try to put away any objects that the cat may try to steal or chew on. If these small objects are swallowed, the cat may choke. Some small objects, such as button batteries, can kill the cat if swallowed.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Never allow two cats to interact face to face right away. Cats are territorial by nature. Your current cat will not react well if you simply introduce a new cat into its territory. Begin the introduction process with a period of confinement.Choose a small room to keep the new cat. Make sure the cat has all the essential, such as food, a litter box, a scratching post, and so on.
At first, keep the new cat's food, water, and other things away from the door. Interacting through the door can help the cats get used to each other, but you should not encourage too much interaction right away.
Cats learn to recognize other animals through scents and pheromones. In order to ease both cats into knowing a new animal, swap toys and bedding. The transition will go smoother if each cat is used to the other cat's scent.For best results, go for items you've seen each cat rubbing up against or nuzzling.
 After a few days, you can begin allowing the cats to interact through the doors. Play with each cat near the door. Move bedding, toys, food, and water closer to the door.The cats may be standoffish and nervous at first, but be persistent. You want the cat to gradually get used to the other animal.
You may see your cats pawing at one another through the door. As long as there is no hissing, this can be seen as a form of play.
 After two to three days of interaction through the doors, switch the cats between confinement areas.Let the new cat explore the house while the old cats are placed in the confinement area. This will get your new cat used to its new home and allow the other cats to get used to the new cat's scent.Switch out the cats several times a day for a few days.
Make sure you only let the new cat roam around the house when you are home to supervise.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Sometimes you can't put a physical barrier up to keep your cat out of a room. In this case, you will need to make the room uncomfortable for it to be in. Make loud noises whenever it enters the room or shoo it away. Note that if you do this, the cat may associate the noise with you and start to avoid you.


You can even employ stronger methods in some cases. For example, spill a small amount of water on the floor of your bathroom if you don't want your cat in there. A cat may hate to get its feet wet on any excess water on the floor.
Another example is to make sure the cat has nowhere to hide in a room. Sometimes a cat likes going under beds or in corners to feel safe. With this type of cat you can block off access to under the bed or any other hiding spaces. This will make your cat uncomfortable in the room.
 Every time it goes near the room, have a spray bottle ready to spray a little water at it. This will make sure it knows that its actions are unacceptable.


However, only use this method if you are prepared to accept damaging your relationship with the cat. It is highly likely the cat will associate the water spray with you, the sprayer, rather than the room. Thus, the cat is more likely to flee and not want to spend time in your company., Put a small amount of vinegar at the room's entrance or in areas of the room. This usually helps, as most cats hate the odor of vinegar. This advice is anecdotal, however, as some people find it helps while for others it makes no difference.


Alternatively, fill a spray bottle halfway with vinegar. Fill the other half with lime or lemon juice. Spray at the entrance to the room and on beds and other places the cat usually goes. This will deter many cats from scratching on furniture or spending time in the room. If you go this route, the vinegar spray needs fairly constant reapplication.
 Make a different room more comfortable for the cat. Make another room cat-appealing so the cat will go there instead. Offer the cat several nice sleeping places (although it's likely to chose its own) including a high perch. Provide food, water, and a litter tray, as well as toys. This involves making a big fuss of the cat and making being in the room you want it to be in a pleasant experience. The goal is to make sure your cat associates the room with good things and wishes to return there. You may want to scatter extra tasty treats around the room so that it seems a more appealing place.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Some parts of the hoof grow faster than others. If the toe grows faster than the heel, the angle of the unshod hoof changes and throws weight backwards. This causes the bulb of the heel to bang against the ground with each step and cause pain. A horse with this tendency has a long, slipper like hoof, rather than a blocky, upright one.


Putting a shoe on these horses elevates the bulbs of the heel off the ground. Now when the horse takes a step he no longer knocks this delicate structure so his pain is relieved.
 Some horses have small hooves relative to their body size, or weight. In these cases there is more pressure per square inch on their hooves than nature intended, and the hooves wear down more quickly than they grow. These animals require shoes.
 A horse with a physical problem with the bones or joints in the lower leg or hoof can be helped with orthopedic shoes. These shoes are fitted by expert farriers and involve creating bespoke shoes that alter the distribution of the horse's weight when standing. This can relieve pressure on a sore joint and make the animal more comfortable.For example, if your horse has long toes and short heels, these orthopedic shoes can help him to walk more easily. Fitting this horse with a shoe that raises the heel can help to ease the pressure on the navicular bone, and encourages more weight bearing on the toe.

No other horses have mottled skin, so this the sure way to tell if a horse is an Appaloosa.In fact, this is one of the ways that official horse registries prove that a horse is an Appaloosa.Look where the hair is thinnest and lightest to see whether a horse has mottled skin. These spots include the nose, mouth, and face (especially around the eyes) as well as the genitals and anus.You can also sometimes see mottled skin patterns beneath white patches in the coat.
Many (though not all) Appaloosas will have well-defined light and dark lines on their hooves. Unfortunately, other horses can sometimes also have these markings if they also have white leg markings.This means that this body feature doesn't prove that a horse is an Appaloosa unless you see it on a horse without white leg markings.
 Most horses have completely dark eyes ‚Äî in other words, there are no "whites" of their eyes. Appaloosas, on the other hand, have eyes like a human's with a white area (called the sclera) around the iris and pupil. Seeing this is a good sign that a horse is an Appaloosa.


Note that, in rare cases, horses with bald faces can also have white sclera even if they're not an Appaloosa. If you see a horse with a bald face and white sclera, this is not enough evidence to identify it as an Appaloosa. Summary: "

Again, make sure the ladder is covered in a soft cloth or carpeting so the cat can get adequate traction.
 You can climb the ladder yourself. Or, if you're afraid of heights, just put the treats as high as you can reach and tap on the step with the treats on it to encourage the cat to climb up.
 If your cat likes to play with a particular toy, use that toy to motivate your cat up the ladder. A string will work best for this, as your cat can follow the string up rung by rung. Keep the cat moving after the toy until it has navigated all the rungs and reached the top of the ladder.
 After trying the treats and toys out, try to encourage your cat by tapping the top of the ladder and calling its name. This final nudge of encouragement may be enough to get your cat up the ladder.
 Teach your cat to associate a click-clack noise with a tasty treat. Then lure your cat to the first rung on the ladder. Click and reward your when he looks at the rung or puts a paw on it. Gradually, your cat will learn he gets a reward for stepping on the ladder and you can start to progress him upwards.
 After trying all of these techniques, your cat may come to associate the ladder with a toy or obstacle to be played with. If this is the case, the cat may ascend the ladder on its own without any treats, toys or encouragement from you.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> The Russian Blue loves food and will often try and trick owners into overfeeding. Do not let this happen because obesity can lead to major health problems, such as diabetes. Because of this, you should stick to scheduled feeding, instead of free range feeding. This way you will be able to monitor your cat‚Äôs food intake and will easily notice if your cat begins to eat less, which could be a sign of a health problem. Give your cat a ¬º cup to a ¬Ω cup of food, twice daily.Feed your cat a premium, grain-free, dry cat food such as Royal Canin, Halo, or Acana.
You can also give your cat more expensive, protein rich, grain-free canned food.
Avoid giving a Russian Blue too many treats because they are susceptible to weight gain.
Water is an important part of a cat's diet, and due to their low thirst drive, some cats do not get enough water.As a result, water should be available for your cat at all times throughout the day. If your cat does not get enough water they could develop kidney or urinary tract problems. In order to prevent this, increase your cat's water intake by:Supplementing your cat‚Äôs diet with premium, canned cat food mixed with a bit of water.
Purchasing a pet fountain from your local pet store in order to make your cat‚Äôs water station more attractive. Cats are more likely to drink water that is running or moving.
Placing multiple water bowls throughout the house and changing the water daily.
 Russian Blues are a very nit-picky breed and many will not even enter the litter box when it is not cleaned.As a result you should scoop out feces daily and fully change the litter box at least twice a week. The Russian Blue is extra particular about hygiene, which means you may have to clean the litter box more frequently. Monitor your cat and find a routine that works.Frequently cleaning the litter box can also reduce smells and odors.
Place the litter box in a quiet space, such as a bathroom or laundry room, in order to reduce odors in your living space. It is also important to make sure that the litter box is not placed behind a closed door because the cat needs to be able to access it at all times.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> While it may take a few weeks for a new bird to get used to you, lories and lorikeets are highly sociable birds. They enjoy being petted and handled. Once your bird seems comfortable in your presence, make petting a part of your daily routine.If your bird seems uncomfortable and moves away from your touch, it may need more time to get used to you. Wait until your bird comes to you and remains relaxed during petting to handle it regularly.
Due to their social nature, lories and lorikeets enjoy time out of the cage with their owner. During downtime, allow your bird to come out of the cage to explore and interact with you. Strive to let your bird out of the cage at least once a day.Make sure any windows are closed and that you remove any hazards, like small items that can be swallowed, before releasing your bird from the cage.
Keep other pets out of the room when letting your bird loose, especially pets like cats that may prey on a bird.
 Lories and lorikeets enjoy being near people and may develop behavioral problems if left alone too often. Keep their cages in a room where you spend a lot of time. If your bird does well out of the cage, bring your bird from room to room with you whenever possible. Summary: "

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> There are several benefits to having your cat come to you when you call her. For example, you can call her when it‚Äôs playtime or mealtime.You can also call your cat if you are unable to locate her in your home.In addition, when your cat knows how to come to you when you call her, you will have the reassurance that she is safely accounted for if you have to leave the house.If your cat is indoor/outdoor, it will be helpful to call her to come back inside.Calling your cat is also beneficial when it is time to leave the house for her veterinary appointment.Your cat may not view a trip to the veterinarian as a pleasant experience, so you may need to allow some extra time to get her come to you when it‚Äôs time to leave for her appointment.
Because cats are naturally intelligent, teaching your cat to come to you when she is called is a great mental exercise for her.
Although positive reinforcement (verbal praise, petting) is an important component of successful training, the key to training your cat to respond to your call is an enticing reward.The most enticing reward for her will probably be food that she thinks is delicious, such as tuna, shredded chicken, or sardines.You can also purchase cat treats at your local pet store.Keep multiple treats on hand. When you reward her, you can vary which food you reward her with so that she does not come to expect the same reward each time.Catnip is not a good reward. Your cat‚Äôs desire for catnip would likely diminish if she receives it more than once a week, so it would be best to select a food treat that will consistently entice her.Whichever food reward you choose, use it only when you call her. It is preferable for your cat to associate that tasty reward with responding to your call and no other commands or verbal cues.Playtime can also be an enticing reward. You can use any verbal cue that you would like.One common verbal cue that cat owners will use is ‚ÄúHere, kitty kitty.‚Äù You can also use the words ‚Äúcome‚Äù or ‚Äútreats.‚ÄùThe verbal cue should not be something that you already use, such as her name.You can also use various tones of voice. Cats typically respond to a high-pitched tone of voice, since their prey usually makes high-pitched sounds in the wild.If you are not the only person in the house who would be calling your cat, make sure that everyone uses the same verbal cue and tone to call her.If your cat is deaf or hard of hearing, you will need to use some different methods to get her attention, such as visual cues‚Äì flicking a light on and off or using a laser pointer (available at your local pet store). Deaf or hearing-impaired cats also respond to vibrations in the floor, so you can thump or stomp of the floor to call your cat. A convenient time to practice calling your cat is around feeding time. Your cat will likely already be hungry, which may make the training process easier and faster.In addition, she will already be used to going to the kitchen (or wherever you keep her food bowl), so you will not be calling her to a room that is unfamiliar to her when you begin training her.


Another benefit to calling her at her regular feeding time is that she will already know what time to get her food.This will make the initial training easier because you will not be doing something that is completely unfamiliar to her.
If you choose to reward with her extra play, then you can practice calling her when it‚Äôs getting close to her scheduled playtime.If the kitchen and her play areas have a lot of distractions, consider calling your cat in a quiet room that doesn‚Äôt have any distractions that could keep her from coming to you. When you are in the room where you want her to come to you, say your verbal cue in a high-pitched voice. If you are calling her when it‚Äôs time for her to eat, make sure that you say the verbal cue before you open a can of food or rip open a bag of food. You want to ensure that your cat comes because she heard your verbal cue, not because of the noises of food preparation.Reward her immediately when she comes to you, whether that is with the tasty treat or extra playtime.Extra positive reinforcement through petting and verbal praise will also be helpful.
Even if you are calling her at mealtime, it is still important to give her the tasty treat as a reward, rather than just feeding her the regular food.
If you are calling her around playtime, say the verbal cue without shaking a toy that makes noise.
It may take her a week or so before she starts to consistently come to you when you call her. Once your cat consistently comes to her play or feeding areas when you call her, take the difficulty up a notch. For example, if someone else lives with you, you can practice calling her back and forth between you and other person. For this challenge, each person should reward her when she correctly responds to the call.If your cat is indoor/outdoor, you can also practice calling her back inside when she is outside.This would be more practical when she is a relatively close distance to the house where she could hear you.
Practice calling her from each of the rooms in your house. Eventually, she will learn how to come to you from wherever she is in your house. Summary: "

Teens should be encouraged not only to eat the full amount of fruits and vegetables every day, they should also be encouraged to consume ‚Äòreal‚Äô food more often. Fast food and processed foods should be avoided as much as possible. Homemade foods and foods made from scratch should be encouraged.One of the fastest ways to eat healthier is to reduce the amount of calories consumed via liquids like pop, juice, energy drinks, milk shakes, etc.
 Kids need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day to stay healthy. But they don‚Äôt have to get that 60 minutes all at once, it can be broken up into smaller, more manageable chunks of 10 to 15 minutes.No matter the weather or the season, send kids outside to play as often as possible.
Parents should participate in physical activities with their kids not only as a means of encouragement and a way to bond, but because the exercise is good for the adults as well.
Set family physical activity goals to achieve together. Participate in charity events like marathons or walk-a-thons as a family.
 Kids need between 9 and 10 hours of sleep every night in order to function properly. Less than 9 to 10 hours of sleep can affect you kid‚Äôs ability to think, learn and make good decisions. Lack of sleep can also impact your kid physically, by increasing their risk of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and depression.Help your kids get enough sleep by creating a bedtime routine or ritual. Establish a specific bedtime that is followed every night, including weekends. Avoid computers and TV an hour before bedtime. Spend the hour before bedtime doing calm activities like brushing teeth and reading a book.
Kids and adults need to have a dark room in order to get a restful night‚Äôs sleep. Ideally, your kid‚Äôs bedroom should be as dark as possible, and their bed should only be used for sleeping.
Avoid big meals right before bedtime. This not only prevents an upset stomach which may keep your kids awake, it may help avoid bad dreams. It‚Äôs also helpful to avoid drinking too much before bed, to help prevent your kids from needing to get up to go to the bathroom when they should be sleeping.
 Technology of any kind ‚Äî TV, video games, computers, cell phones, etc. ‚Äî should have daily limits. Once those daily limits are reached, encourage kids to perform a physical activity instead, without their technology.Areas like the dinner table should be designated as ‚Äúno tech zones‚Äù where electronic items are not allowed ‚Äî for BOTH parents and kids. Instead face-to-face (old-fashioned) communication should be encouraged.
 Many kids have never known a world without the internet. They interact, play, and learn online. But kids can also be taken advantage of online, and need to understand the right way to behave when in their online communities.Parents should be effective role models of what good online communication should be. Kids like to mimic what adults do, so if they see you swearing and acting rude online, they may attempt to do the same thing. If they see you being kind and using good manners online, they may follow your lead.
Teach your kids about cyber bullying. Don‚Äôt hide the stories about children who have been cyber bullied, instead share these stories with your kids and talk about them. Discuss how your kids should react under similar circumstances (i.e. tell their parents or teacher, don‚Äôt post personal info or photos, etc.).

If the bedsore is bleeding or seeping fluid from it, you may have fairly serious bedsores and need to consult a doctor immediately to prevent further damage and to manage pain.An offensive odor may indicate infection in the wound, in which case you should see a doctor immediately.
 Before visiting the doctor, you should be prepared with answers to a variety of questions you may be asked.Questions might include:


How long has the skin discoloration been present?
How painful is your skin in these areas?
Have you had a recurring fever?
Have you had bedsores before?
How frequently are you changing positions or moving around?
What is your diet like?
How much water do you drink every day?

, The doctor will ask you questions about your health, the nature of the sore areas, your diet and other topics. They will also conduct a physical examination, looking at your body and paying close attention to areas that are noticeably sore, discolored or tough to the touch. They may also take urine and blood samples to rule out particular conditions and to assess your overall health. There are 4 stages into which bedsores can be categorized. Stages I and II are less serious and can be treated and healed. Stages III and IV require medical intervention and possibly surgery to treat properly.Stage I: The skin has some level of discoloration but there is no open wound. For lighter complexions, the skin may look red; for darker complexions, the skin may look blue, purple or even white.

Stage II: There is an open wound that is still shallow. The edges of the wound are infected or have dead tissue.

Stage III: The wound is wide open and deep. It extends below the top layer of skin into the fat tissue layers. It may have fluid or pus in the wound.

Stage IV: The wound is large, affecting several layers of skin tissue. Muscle or bone may be exposed, and there may be eschar, which is a dark substance that indicates necrotic (dead) tissue.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> There are a number of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that can help you sleep better. The best nutrients for better sleep include magnesium, potassium, calcium, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and vitamin D. These help various chemical messengers in your brain, which are starved for these nutrients, accomplish their functions related to sleep.These vitamins and minerals are also great for your overall health. This means that improving your sleep through food may also help improve your overall health.
 The best way to get these nutrients is by eating foods rich in each of these nutrients every day. This means you need to watch what you eat and try to incorporate as much of these minerals as possible.


You may also be able to increase these minerals with supplements, but your body will absorb the nutrients better if they come from food. When you are trying to get the right minerals and nutrients, you should spread them out. Eat healthy, nutrient-rich foods across multiple meals. This means you shouldn‚Äôt load all your nutritious food into one meal and then eat food devoid of nutrients at other times of the day.


Try to get at least eight to 10 servings of these foods throughout the day.
If you find this hard, start small. Add just one new type of food, such as a leafy green salad or a small cup of fruit, to each meal. This will help ease you into larger portions of these nutrient-rich foods throughout at day. As you get used to them, slowly replace other foods with these foods. When you are eating for sleep health, try picking foods that have more than one of the helpful nutrients in them. This will allow you to get the most benefit from these foods each time you eat them.


For example, avocados have magnesium and potassium in them, so eating them raw, in a sandwich, or on a salad may help you get better sleep by increasing two different sleep helping nutrients. If you are prone to getting bored with what you eat, try out different types of snacks rich in these vitamins and minerals. Don‚Äôt make it hard on yourself, either. If you know that you don‚Äôt like one thing rich in sleep-helping nutrients, change to another. It is better to find what you like than to keep yourself from any of the nutrients at all.


For example, if you really hate bananas, which are strong in magnesium, switch them with a handful of berries or a serving of cashews instead.
You can also incorporate them into recipes, such as making chicken stir-fry with cashews and broccoli or a large kale salad with almonds, salmon, and cherries. Summary: "

Toddlers should get at least 30 minutes of planned physical activity and 60 minutes of free play each day.
Preschoolers should get at least 60 minutes of planned physical activity and 60 minutes of free play each day.
School age children should get at least an hour of physical activity each day. Each bout of physical activity should last for a minimum of 15 minutes. While you are sleeping, your body releases growth hormone. While missing one night of sleep will not stunt your growth, not getting enough sleep over time can negatively impact your growth.The amount of sleep you need will depend on your age and activity level.


Newborn babies (0-3 months) need between 10.5 and 18 hours of sleep per day.
Infants (4-11 months) need about 9 to 12 hours of sleep at night and a few naps throughout the day.
Toddlers (1-2 years old) need about 11 to 14 hours of sleep a day.Preschoolers (3-5 years old) need 11 to 13 hours of sleep each night.
School aged children (6 to 13 years old) need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Teenagers usually need about 8.5 to 9 hours of sleep each night.
 Smoking is a sure way to stunt your growth, especially during puberty. Smoking only 10 cigarettes a day for a few years can cause you to be one inch shorter than you would have been.Smoking marijuana can also stunt your growth by decreasing your body's ability to produce growth hormone.To reach your maximum height, it is best if you do not smoke any substance.

Your doctor will probably advise you to avoid standing for long periods of time, exerting yourself with physical exercise or engaging in sexual activity during the initial 24 to 48 hours of amniocentesis recovery. It is also a good idea to avoid stressful situations that could place undue strain on you and your baby during this time.
Call your doctor if any symptoms occur.


While mild cramping is completely normal for the first day or 2 after amniocentesis, pain or cramping in the lower back or abdomen that does not subside should be checked out by your doctor. Contractions, where the abdomen tightens and then relaxes, can also accompany cramping and may signify premature labor has begun. This symptom also requires an immediate call to your doctor, to ensure labor does not progress if you are not full term yet.
A small amount of spotting from the cervix can also occur during amniocentesis recovery, but if the bleeding becomes heavy or is accompanied by a loss of clear fluid, emergency medical attention is required. Bleeding or discharge from the site of the amniocentesis is also cause for concern.
A patient recovering from amniocentesis should also be on the lookout for signs of a developing infection, such as a fever, chills or discharge from the vagina or amniocentesis site. Antibiotics may be needed to keep the infection in check so it does not harm the mother or unborn baby.
 If the baby is moving more or less than what was typical before the amniocentesis, check with your doctor to see if an evaluation of the baby (such as an ultrasound) is warranted.
 Because this test is often used to screen for potentially serious issues with the baby, the wait for results can be a stressful time.


Spend time with your spouse, family members or close friends who can offer you the support you need during this difficult time of waiting. Remember that the large majority of amniocentesis results come back completely normal, so the odds of serious problem are usually slim. Professional counseling may also be helpful, particularly if the results of the amniocentesis are not positive and the baby has a genetic or developmental problem.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> This condition does not endanger your life, and will resolve itself on its own in most situations. However, it may take up to a year to resolve completely, so there are some exercises you can do to help speed up the recovery process.
 Usually, the treatment for this condition when it occurs in adults is physiotherapy. It is important to see a professional because exercises that are done incorrectly could actually lead to a worsening of the condition.


One of the suggested exercises is listed below.
 These exercises help strengthen pelvic floor muscles and deep abdominal muscles, which can help to resolve this condition. You can start these exercises during pregnancy and continue them after the birth, unless stated otherwise by your physician. These exercises are basically contractions and relaxations of your pelvic muscles.


First of all, you need to identify the right muscles; in order to do this you need to stop urination in midstream. The muscles that you use to do this are the muscles you must relax and contract during these exercises. After this task is complete, you need to completely empty your bladder and stay on your back, relaxed. Try to contract and relax these muscles, holding each contraction and relaxation for give seconds. Repeat this process five times a day.
Once you feel comfortable with this duration of time, you can relax and contract for 10 seconds each; do these exercises three times a day.
 Some doctors believe that surgical realignment is the best way to speed up the recovery process. Others believe that surgery should only be done as a last resort if the condition does not clear up by itself over the course of a year or two, or when the diastasis recti is extremely severe.


The operation that would be performed, should you choose to have it done, is called abdominoplasty (this is also called a tummy tuck). During the surgery, your muscles will be realigned and your skin will be elevated from the pubic region to your breast bone. Summary: "

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Start by educating yourself about how pregnancy starts. Many studies have found that the better education you have regarding how sex and pregnancy work, the better able you will be to make good decisions regarding sex. You can find lots of high quality information online using sources like Mayo Clinic and Wikipedia.


The short version is that a man produces a substance in his body, called semen, which exits his body through the penis. This substance is deposited in a woman‚Äôs vagina (through sex or other means), where it combines with an egg in her uterus to form a baby. Women only have eggs in their uterus sometimes and even then, the egg doesn‚Äôt always get what it needs from the semen. This is why you won‚Äôt get pregnant every time you have sex.
There are lots of myths about how you can get pregnant. If you know the truth from the facts, you‚Äôll be much better able to protect yourself. Remember, when it doubt, play it safe. It‚Äôs better to wait until you have proper protection than risk getting pregnant because of something you read on Tumblr.


Myth: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get pregnant if you have sex during your period.‚Äù Your body will usually release an egg half-way in between your periods...but loads of women can have an egg release just about any time in their cycle. In fact, this method may be more likely to get some women pregnant, so don‚Äôt rely on this to help you.
Myth: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get pregnant if you use the pull-out method.‚Äù The pull-out method is when the guy pulls his penis out of the vagina before ejaculating or ‚Äúcumming‚Äù (orgasming and releasing his semen). The problem is that the penis will release fluid before ejaculation that can still get a girl pregnant! Using the pull-out method is very unreliable and for most people, the chances of getting pregnant with this form of ‚Äúbirth control‚Äù is about 30%.Myth: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get pregnant if you use certain positions or have sex in certain places.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre having sex in a pool/hot tub or if the girl is on top during sex. If there‚Äôs a penis in a vagina, pregnancy can happen.
Myth: ‚ÄúYou can get pregnant if you do _______ afterwards.‚Äù Unless that blank is filled with medication or medical devices like Plan B or an IUD, then this is a total myth. Jumping jacks, douching, showering, peeing, eating certain foods: you name it, these things won‚Äôt help keep you from getting pregnant.
 We don‚Äôt want to sound like that guy at your church, but abstinence really is your best bet at not getting pregnant. Even the most effective forms of birth control only work most of the time. If you want to guarantee that you won‚Äôt get pregnant, find other ways of getting sexual release that don‚Äôt involve penetration.


Pregnancy isn‚Äôt the only risk of sex, either. It‚Äôs important to remember that. You also need to be safe and use protection to keep yourself from getting STDs.
There are also merits to taking things slow, in your relationship. While sex is fun and feels good, it adds a lot of complication. You might think you‚Äôll have fewer problems once you start having sex but really you‚Äôll have more. This is why, if you can make it work, it‚Äôs better to stay abstinent until you‚Äôre in a place in your life where you‚Äôre better able to deal with those complications.
 Full, penetrative sex isn‚Äôt the only way to get sexual release. If you don‚Äôt have access to birth control or if you just want to be super sure that you don't get pregnant or get anyone else pregnant, try other ways of getting physical that don't lead to babies.


Try something like mutual masturbation. This is where you stimulate yourself in front of your partner or you stimulate each other. As long as no penetration occurs and the man's semen is kept away from the vagina, no pregnancy can occur. This is also relatively safe in terms of protecting you from disease.
You can try something like oral or anal sex. This should still be done with a condom, however, because both can still spread disease and infections.
 Talk to an adult that you trust about sex, sexual health, relationships, and pregnancy. They should at least be able to give you some advice. They might even be able to help you find resources so that you can better protect yourself from getting pregnant. Schedule some private time to talk with them and then tell them why you want to talk. It might be awkward at first and it might take more than one conversation, but you‚Äôll find that having someone who can help you will make you much more comfortable and happy.


Say something like, ‚ÄúBrian, I‚Äôm not comfortable going to mom and dad, but I really want to get intimate with my girlfriend and I‚Äôm worried about her getting pregnant. Can you help me choose the right condoms?‚Äù

, In lots of states, you can get birth control from doctors and pharmacies without your parents legally needing to be told. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to your family about your situation, make an appointment with an organization like Planned Parenthood. They‚Äôll educate you and get you everything that you need at a price you can afford, so that your parents don‚Äôt need to know about what you‚Äôre doing.


You can find your local Planned Parenthood clinic by visiting their website.
If you live outside the US or in an area not serviced by Planned Parenthood, check with your local health department to get advice about what services might be available to you.
 There are lots of reasons that you might want to stay away from drugs and alcohol, but one of the major ones is that both can lead you to make really bad decisions. When you‚Äôre drunk or high, your brain doesn‚Äôt work as well as normal (that‚Äôs why it feels so good). This means that while you might normally make the smart choice and use a condom, your drunk brain doesn‚Äôt even consider it.


You also have to worry about what might happen while you‚Äôre passed out. When you‚Äôve had so much alcohol or enough drugs to make it so that you can‚Äôt move or are passed out, you have no control over what other people do to your body.
For example, more than 20% of teen pregnancies were the result of sex that was influenced by alcohol. Summary: "

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> If you're suffering from morning sickness, sometimes the last thing you feel like doing is eating. However, it is important that your body gets the vitamins and nutrients it needs to keep you and your growing baby healthy.


Try to avoid an empty stomach by eating small, frequent meals throughout the day.
You should also try to eat at a slower pace than you normally would to avoid overeating, which may make you feel even worse.
It's extremely important that you stay hydrated, especially if you're getting sick frequently. If you let yourself become dehydrated, you will feel even more nauseated. Sip fluids throughout the day, using a straw if it helps. Try to refrain from drinking 30 minutes before or after eating, however.


You should try to drink about 6 to 8 glasses of water each day. However, if you've been getting sick a lot, you can try replacing some of the water with a sports drink containing glucose, salt, or potassium to help restore lost electrolytes.Alternatively, you can try drinking cold, carbonated beverages, as some women find these easier on the stomach. Other women also find sour drinks, like lemonade, easier to keep down.
Avoid drinking too many fluids, though. Liquids can give you a false sense of fullness which may cause you to feel less hungry throughout the day. Many women insist that crackers are a necessity when dealing with morning sickness. They make a great snack as they are portable, inexpensive and easy to digest. Keep a stash of dry crackers beside your bed and eat a few before getting up in the morning, then continue to nibble on them throughout the day.If you need to get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, try eating a cracker or two then as well. They'll help stave off hunger and settle your stomach before the morning.It doesn't matter what kind of crackers you eat, saltines, wheat thins, rice cakes - it's a matter of personal preference. If you're not a cracker fan, try eating dry cereal instead.
Avoid coating your crackers in greasy butter or fatty spreads, they may make you feel more unwell and are harder to digest. Eat the crackers dry, if possible.
 Stick to bland foods as much as possible when dealing with morning sickness. They smell less strongly and are easy to digest.


Do your best to avoid spicy, acidic, and fried foods, as these are more likely to upset your stomach.
Try the BRAT diet, which consists of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods are bland and low in fiber and thus gentle on your digestive track. They are also very inexpensive.You can also add tea and yogurt to the list to go on the BRATTY diet.
 After a while, you will start to notice that certain foods or smells will trigger your nausea. It may be pizza, bacon or anything at all. Once you know your triggers, you can take steps to avoid them.Try making a note of when and why you feel queasy every day, in order to identify your food triggers.
 Indulge your cravings, especially if it helps you to feel better. If you have a craving for a particular food, your body may be trying to tell you something. If you are craving dairy, perhaps you need calcium. If you are craving peanut butter, perhaps you need protein or more calories. A lot of women find carbohydrate-filled foods the most appealing when feeling nauseated. Stock up your cupboards with carbohydrate-rich pasta, bread, pretzels and granola bars. Some women find that high protein foods help to ease their morning sickness. Whether it's scrambled eggs, peanut butter, or a lean piece of meat, try to find a protein-rich food that works for you. Try to eat your food either cold or at room temperature, because food tends to have a more pervasive smell when heated, and strong aromas can be major triggers for morning sickness.Stick to sandwiches, fruit and raw vegetables, and salad (when it's properly prepared to prevent listeria).
 Fatty foods take longer to digest and can be rough on your digestive system, which can worsen feelings of nausea.They are also less healthy, providing fewer nutrients than other types of foods and have a tendency to smell quite strongly, which isn't good. Avoid!

, Brush your teeth thoroughly and swirl some mouthwash after you eat. This will prevent odors and tastes from hanging around your mouth after eating. Get your partner to brush his teeth too, while you're at it. Nothing like a pepperoni pizza breath kiss to trigger your gag reflex.
 You should avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after eating, as the horizontal position can interfere with digestion and lead to queasiness. Summary: "

To help combat this before these health issues arise during menopause, you can start doing pelvic exercises, called Kegel exercises, to help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.Kegels are a series of muscle tensing and releasing exercises in different positions and for different lengths of time. You can identify the muscles used in Kegels by trying to stop the flow of urine as you pee. The muscles you squeeze to accomplish this are the muscles you will be working curing Kegels.
Start out by squeezing your pelvic floor muscles for two to five seconds, then release for 10 seconds. Do this ten times to complete one set. Do one set three to four times daily.
Increase the time you squeeze and hold your muscles to 10-second intervals. Continue to do three to four sets daily.
Kegels can be done just about anywhere and at any time. Do them while driving, sitting at your desk, watching TV, or whenever works for you.
 When you are preparing for the changes your body goes through during menopause, you can start to avoid the substances that trigger hot flashes. This will help them to get out of your system before you start menopause so you won‚Äôt start out with bad hot flashes.


These triggers include hot and caffeinated beverages, alcohol, and spicy foods.
Many of these things trigger other menopause symptoms as well, so you will be healthier and more prepared overall if you avoid these. One of the major side effects of the reduction in estrogen during menopause is vaginal dryness. Before you go through menopause, you can ask what your doctor can do for you if this happens. A common treatment that is prescribed during menopause is vaginal estrogen, which is a cream, rings, or tablet inserted directly into the vagina to be absorbed by the tissues.


You can prepare for this eventual health change by seeing if your insurance covers these treatments, looking into types of these medications that you have access to, and stocking up on these medications.
These treatments will help with dryness and discomfort during sex.You can also look into the best over-the-counter lubricants or moisturizers so you are ready when this symptoms occurs.

First stage: Early labor starts at 0 centimeters (0.0¬†in) dilation and ends at 3 centimeters (1.2¬†in). This is when the cervix softens and thins out. This is also called effacing or effacement. Contractions will probably be mild and last 30 seconds. Active labor, also known as the transition phase, is when the cervix continues to open in preparation for delivering the baby during the second stage of labor. The cervix dilation is at 10 centimeters (3.9¬†in) at the end of active labor. During active labor the contractions may last up to 60 seconds. Active labor usually lasts 8 hours for first time mothers.



 


Second stage: The cervix is fully effaced and the baby is delivered. During this stage the woman will feel the need to push. The baby will move downward usually making a few steps forward and then moving back during this process. Eventually a small portion of the baby's scalp will be seen. During the final stage the woman may feel extreme pressure and an urge to bear down. The baby's head will crown and leading to the rest of the delivery.






Third stage: The placenta is delivered during this stage. Any suturing will be done after the placenta is delivered.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Most cases of placenta previa are diagnosed during a routine appointment. Whether you have concerns about this condition or not, regular prenatal care is one of the most important aspects of a healthy pregnancy. See your midwife or obstetrician regularly, and do not skip appointments.


Getting regular care means seeing your doctor as soon as you think you're pregnant. After that, your doctor will schedule appointments as needed.
In general, you should contact your doctor if you have vaginal bleeding at any point in your pregnancy; it can indicate a potential miscarriage or a number of other problems. If you have bright red bleeding (but no pain) at any point from the second trimester onward, it may also be a symptom of placenta previa.Bleeding related to placenta previa can be light or heavy, and it is not necessarily constant; it may stop and then recur.
If your bleeding is heavy, it's best to go to the emergency room instead of waiting to hear from your doctor. To confirm the presence of placenta previa, your doctor will order an ultrasound to view the location of your placenta. In some cases, you may need to undergo both an abdominal and a transvaginal ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasounds are performed by inserting a narrow transducer into your vagina.You may also need an MRI, but that test is not often done. Like bleeding, contractions before your ninth month always merit a visit to your doctor. These contractions might indicate preterm labor or other problems, or they may be a sign of placenta previa.It can be difficult to distinguish between true contractions and the normal Braxton-Hicks contractions that many women notice during pregnancy. Do not feel worried or embarrassed about checking with your doctor to be sure. Generally, the clich√© that it‚Äôs better to be safe than sorry applies here.
 If your doctor diagnoses you with placenta previa, ask for the specifics. There are several different kinds, including a low-lying placenta, a partial placenta previa, and a total placenta previa.A low-lying placenta means that the placenta is attached to the lower part of your uterus but is not covering the cervix. These cases often resolve themselves before delivery; the placenta may move upward as your pregnancy advances.A partial placenta previa means that the placenta is covering part of the cervix, but not all of it. Many of these cases also resolve themselves before delivery.A total placenta previa covers the cervical opening completely, making a normal vaginal delivery unlikely. These cases are much less likely to clear up before delivery. Several factors put you more at risk for this condition. For instance, if you are over 30 or have had a pregnancy before, you are at a higher risk for this condition. Also, if you are having more than one baby or if you have scarring in your uterus, you're at higher risk for placenta previa.It's important to stop smoking while pregnant for a number of reasons, but it also increases your chance of developing this condition. One treatment for placenta previa is just to slow down some. In other words, you'll want to take some of your more strenuous activities off the table. You won't be able to do exercises or many of your normal activities.In addition, you shouldn't travel if you have this condition. If you are not experiencing heavy bleeding, your doctor may prescribe bed rest at home. The specifics may vary depending on your particular case, but in general, bed rest is just like it sounds: you‚Äôll lie down most of the time and sit or stand only when necessary.However, bed rest can cause health risks, including Deep Vein Thrombosis, so it is less commonly recommended than it used to be.If your doctor recommends bed rest, ask her for her rationale or get a second opinion.
 Pelvic rest means that you cannot perform activities involving your vaginal area. You can't have sex, douche, or wear a tampon, for instance. If you have a low-lying placenta or a partial placenta previa, the issue may resolve itself. Some women with these mild forms of the condition find that by the time they deliver, the placenta has moved. The biggest risk to your health is the heavy bleeding that can accompany placenta previa. Occasionally, women with placenta previa experience uterine hemorrhages that could potentially be fatal. Whether you are at home or in the hospital, watch for signs of heavy bleeding.If you notice sudden heavy bleeding, it's best to go to the emergency room.
 When you have this condition, your doctor will likely limit the time she spends examining you vaginally, as that can exacerbate the condition. In addition, she will use ultrasounds to determine where the baby is over time, and your baby's heartbeat may need to be looked at more closely. While medications will not directly treat the condition, you may be given drugs to prolong the pregnancy (so you don't give birth early), as well as corticosteroids to help your baby's lungs develop if you must give birth early. You may also be given blood transfusions due to blood loss. Because this condition can become severe, you may need to go to the hospital for medical care at any given point. If you start bleeding or your bleeding becomes suddenly heavier, you need to go to the emergency room. If you are bleeding moderately to heavily, your doctor may recommend that you enter the hospital. In the hospital, you will be able to lie down most of the time with medical personnel available if any problem arises. If your bleeding cannot be controlled or if you or your baby show signs of considerable distress, your doctor may need to perform a cesarean section. This step may be necessary even if you are not yet approaching your due date.If you are not bleeding heavily and the placenta is blocking the cervix, you may be able to have a natural birth.However, about 3/4 of women who have this condition in the third trimester are not able to give birth vaginally. Doctors commonly recommend delivering a few weeks early with this condition.If you have had a prior caesarean delivery and have placenta previa, you are at higher risk for a condition called placenta accreta. This is a serious condition in which the placenta does not detach after childbirth. You will need to make sure you deliver in a hospital that is prepared for this situation, including having a well-stocked blood bank. Read up on placenta previa and cesarean section, which may be a necessary consequence of the condition. Feeling more informed may make you feel less anxious and more in control. Talk to your partner or to a trusted friend or relative about any sadness, depression, frustration, worry, or anxiety you may be feeling. It‚Äôs natural to experience these feelings when your pregnancy does not go as you anticipated, and it‚Äôs vital to get these emotions out into the open.Another option is to join an online support group. Online support groups exist for people with placenta previa and people on bed rest. Consider joining one. These groups can provide much-needed commiseration and suggestions for coping strategies. If you are stuck in bed, either at home or at the hospital, try to make the best of the situation. Be productive in ways that are compatible with bed rest: research and purchase baby supplies online, write thank you notes to people who have sent gifts, and take care of any work-related obligations that you can do from bed. But don‚Äôt forget to spend time on the things that will make you feel calmer, happier, or less bored.For instance, you could watch your favorite movies or TV shows, read a good book, play computer or video games, have phone or Skype conversations with friends and family members, challenge someone to a board or card game, or keep a journal or a blog.
 Having placenta previa is certainly not ideal, and bed rest can be a challenge. However, with proper treatment, you can expect to have a healthy baby, as most women with this condition do. Summary: "

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> If you start bleeding bright red after having gotten past that state to pink or brown, you need more rest.If you completely soak a pad within an hour, you should call a doctor. While the amount of rest you need will vary from person to person, increased bleeding or decreased mood suggests you should be getting more rest. The main reason for this is that because there are potential vaginal tears, as well as damage in the uterus, you can get an infection. It will also be uncomfortable immediately after birth to have sex, as you are likely to be sore.You should wait until the bleeding is almost gone before having sex. You may not feel like you need to go, but keeping the bladder somewhat empty will help ease contractions. This will help to decrease pain and bleeding. You should call your doctor if you have the typical symptoms of a urinary tract infection, such as burning urination or a persistent urge to urinate. You should try to get the iron you need from food sources, such as meats, beans and lentils, and certain vegetables such as broccoli or okra. This is because too much iron can cause constipation. You should only take an iron supplement if your doctor recommends it. Tampons can increase the chance of infection, and there are plenty of pads out there that can handle most flows.Consider using overnight or heavy flow pads, especially in the first week or so. You can even use pads regularly meant for urinary incontinence, as they tend to be bigger and more absorbent. These are mesh underwear that you can wear during the heavy period of postpartum bleeding. You will usually receive some pairs from the hospital. However, you can buy them online as well. They are more convenient than traditional underwear, especially in the first few days after labor, when you‚Äôll want to do nothing but rest. This will help protect your mattress during sleep, and will give you some ease about leaks that can occur. If your flow is really heavy or you don‚Äôt want to stain your sheets, you might want to use a comfortable bed pad that rests on top of the sheets. Using them when sitting on upholstered furniture, the carpet, or any other surface you want to protect from blood stains. These may not be necessary after the first week or so.Using disposable pads are definitely more convenient, but you can use reusable ones if you want to be more environmentally friendly. While some clots are normal, larger ones should raise concern. This can be a sign of postpartum hemorrhage, which can be fatal if left untreated. Other symptoms include pain in the vaginal region and low blood pressure. If you have a fever of over 100.4 degrees, you should check with your doctor. It can be a sign of a serious infection. Fever with any of these other symptoms is especially concerning. If you notice that the vaginal discharge smells significantly different from your menstrual period, you may need medical attention.Foul-smelling postpartum bleeding may indicate the presence of an infection. If you are soaking a pad once an hour for more than two hours, you should call your doctor. It should be noted that normal moderate to heavy bleeding lasts for the first week or so. While the period may vary some, a return to very heavy bleeding should be looked into. It should typically last two to six weeks. While it is normal for about 15% women to experience bleeding after six weeks, you will still want to talk to your doctor at your post-natal check, especially if the extended time occurs with any other symptoms.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Not knowing the causes and risk factors of an illness often leads to exposure to those factors. Ask your doctor to help you develop a better understanding of the disease and how to avoid it.Know the statistics. Age, weight, genetics, and other cancers are all factors in contracting cancer, so compare your own profile with that of the high-risk candidate. For example, women over 50 are at the most risk of getting uterine cancer, while overweight women are also more likely candidates for uterine cancer.Other factors considered to increase one's risk are: nulliparity (never giving birth), unopposed estrogen therapy (if you still have a uterus), early onset of menses, late menopause, PCOS, a history of anovulation, obesity and excessive weight, diabetes or related issues, and exposure to certain medical chemicals like Estrogen replacements.
If you started menstruation early or experienced a late menopause, you have a higher risk of uterine cancer. This is because the longer one menstruates, the longer one is exposed to relatively high levels of estrogen. Early detection is one of the most effective tools in treating cancer, so plan to see your doctor every one to two years for checkups. Also, talk with your doctor if you notice any bleeding after menopause or if you have irregular periods.


Keep track of any irregular or abnormal vaginal bleeding and tell your doctor about any symptoms you are having when you go for appointments.
Review test results with your doctor to ensure that you understand everything.
Make a special medical calendar and hang it in a prominent place so that you won‚Äôt miss your appointments.
 Estrogen is only a risk factor for uterine cancer if it is given without progesterone. Talk to your doctor about any concerns you have before undergoing a postmenopausal hormone regimen.The breast cancer medication Tamoxifen has also been linked to uterine cancer, but the general consensus of the medical community regarding this drug determines that its benefits largely outweigh its potential risks. Women who have or might have hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) have a substantially increased likelihood of contracting uterine cancer. If you or family members have had colon or endometrial cancer before, you should consider getting genetic counseling to test for the genetic mutation dictating HNPCC.Cowden syndrome and BRCA1 may also raise your risk of uterine cancer.

Some diseases can increase your risk of miscarriage, though many of these diseases can be prevented through simple vaccinations. If you are unsure of your vaccination history, check your vaccination record.


You may need to undergo blood testing to determine whether or not you received certain vaccinations as a child.
It is best to get vaccinated before you plan to conceive, so check your record early.
 Thyroid disease, epilepsy, and lupus are thought to increase the risk of miscarriage, though it is entirely likely that you can still have a healthy baby if you have one of these diseases. Be sure to disclose your family disease history to your doctor. You should begin this dosage one to two months before you plan to conceive. Folic acid helps to reduce the chance that your baby will be born with birth defects.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> If the pregnancy came as a surprise, you'll need to decide if you want to keep the baby or not. Think about whether you're in a place to raise a child, both physically and financially. If you're not, could you make the necessary changes to care for the child? A child is a big responsibility, emotionally, physically, and financially. While no parent is perfect, you should at least want the responsibility of caring for another human life. Think about whether you would want to raise a child with the father of the baby. Your relationship needs to be mature enough to handle the responsibility of caring for and raising a child.If the father is someone you would considering raising a child with, discuss your pregnancy with them to see how you want to move forward together.


If the father is not around, discuss the pregnancy and your situation with someone who cares about you, such as a parent or a sibling, just to have someone to bounce ideas off of.
 If you decide to go through with having the baby, you'll start prenatal care.Prenatal care is basically keeping the baby healthy through regular checkups at the doctor. Your doctor will check on your own health, including screening for sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes, and the health of the baby at your first visit. Your doctor will help you set up a schedule for the rest of your visits. You may decide that you don't want to have the baby, and that's a valid choice. If that's the case, your main option is an abortion, though the morning after pill can work up to five days after you've had sex.Research abortion clinics in your area. They can help you with your options. Keep in mind, though, many states and countries have laws in place that require doctors to tell you certain information, which is intended to discourage you from having an abortion. Don't let it discourage you if an abortion is what you desire - just make sure you are fully aware of all the risks involved in having an abortion. Some states may require an ultrasound before you can have an abortion. Depending on the state, you may need to get your parent's permission if you're under 18.The two main types of abortion in the first trimester are medical and surgical. Don't let the word "surgical" scare you, as it generally doesn't involve any cutting. Usually, a tube or forceps are used to open your cervix, and then a suction action is used.A medical abortion is when a pill is used to induce abortion. If you want to have the baby but feel like you can't raise it yourself, then giving your baby up for adoption can be another option. It is a difficult decision to make, and it is one that is binding, once the papers are signed. If you think this option is for you, begin by reading books about it, researching on the internet, talking to close friends, and talking to an adoption lawyer or an adoption professional.Talk to the father. In many states in the United States, the father has to give his consent before the adoption becomes official. If you are under 18, you need to talk to your parents before making a decision.
Decide what kind of adoption you want. You can go through an agency or you can hire a lawyer to arrange an independent adoption outside of an agency.
Choose the adoptive parents carefully. You may want a family who raises your child in your faith tradition, or you may want a family that's open to you being in the child's life. Also, in some adoptions, the parents may pay for your prenatal care and other medical expenses.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Aerobic exercise is when oxygenated blood gets pumped to deliver oxygen to the muscles. Given that roughly half of American, middle-aged adults complain of insomnia, figuring out how to improve sleep through aerobic exercise is of utmost importance. Some basic improved sleep concepts follow:Get your heart rate going, but make it moderate enough to allow you to still keep up a conversation. You can choose fast walking, swimming, jogging, cross-country skiing, biking, dancing or using an elliptical machine.
Work out at roughly 75% of your max heart rate (i.e. 220 minus age). Take your heart rate while working out, counting the number of heart beats in 15 seconds and then multiple it by four.
Try to exercise five times a week for 30 minutes. More is fine, but less is not preferred.
Keep at it for about four months. Results will not be immediate, but after an extended time there will be visual benefits as well as probable sleep improvements.
Not only will exercise improve general nighttime sleep, but it will also improve the post-lunch fog that falls over most people.
Some studies have indicated minimal physiological difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise.Try pushing yourself as hard as you can in short bursts. Training anaerobically literally means you‚Äôre training without oxygen, so you won't be able to do the exercises for extended periods. Figure a way to periodically go as hard as possible.


Try to aim for 85% of your max heart rate, or higher, to go anaerobic.
Sprint like your life depends on it. You won‚Äôt make it far, but build in a few rest periods and it will wear you out enough to produce the desired physical and sleep-related results.
Jump up and down with weights. Start with small dumbbells at first, and either increase the weight or the height of the jump as you become accustomed to the difficulty.
People who engaged in regular anaerobic activity lost fat more quickly, and secreted more growth hormones, which helps you to repair your body's systems, heal more quickly, and rest more soundly.You may also wish to try high-intensity interval training in which you alternate periods of low-intensity exercise (like walking) with bursts of high-intensity exercise (like sprinting).
 Lifting weights has been shown to aid sleep in a variety of ways. Aim to lift weights two to three times per week with plenty of rest between muscle group sessions. Once you feel comfortable with a specific weight, make gradual 5‚Äì10 percent increases to the repetitions or the weight.Not only does strength training improve sleep, it also lowers weight and helps fight off sleep apnea.
Weight lifting helps with depression.Since sleep is a time for muscle recovery, resistance training acts as a jump-start towards sleep. You may even fall asleep faster and make it through the entire night without interruption.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Although this might seem like something that would add stress to your life, it can actually be quite comforting for you to know that everything is planned out for when you will not be able to take care of things.Finalizing the plans for getting to the hospital and having everything packed and ready to go makes it much easier to relax and enjoy the last few weeks of pregnancy. After all of the plans are in place, you will have less to worry about and will hopefully be able to relax a bit more.
This plan should cover your preferences regarding the details of your child‚Äôs birth, such as what medication you will be administered, and whether or not your baby will be circumcised, if he is a boy. Many women find it helpful to put their birth plan in writing so that everyone involved in the birthing process is aware of her preferences since she may not be capable of expressing them clearly while giving birth.It is important to also add some clauses about what you prefer if something changes, such as the need for an emergency caesarean if the baby is having difficulties during the birth.
 If there are other children in the family or pets in the home, plans should be made for someone to care for them while you are giving birth. This person or persons should be reliable and readily available at any time of day or night.


In addition, unless they volunteer, it is usually best to choose someone besides the immediate family, since they may want to be at the hospital when the baby is born.
 Since few babies are actually born when they are expected, it is a good idea for you to clear your calendar for several weeks toward the end of your pregnancy. This means that you should take care of all of your routine appointments, even if it is a little ahead of schedule.


Some appointments to consider are the dentist, hair salon, pediatric appointments for other children in the family, and veterinarian appointments for household pets.
Once all of the appointments are finished and out of the way, you will not have to worry about forgetting to call to cancel them when the baby comes.
 Another appointment that should be made is a tune up for your vehicle. It is important to be sure that it in good working condition before the baby is born. This includes such things as checking the condition of the wiper blades, which many people don‚Äôt consider until there is a problem.
 Put in everything that you need for you and your baby. These things include diapers, hygiene products, clothes for you and baby, and towels.Select the clothing that you will wear on your way out of the hospital.

Look for groups composed of pregnant women who may be experiencing similar emotions as you. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable meeting in person, you can always find online support and chat groups as well.


When you attend, listen actively but also jump in with questions and share your thoughts. Talking with others will show that your struggles with negative emotions are important, but not necessarily unusual.
To find support groups online, you might search for "prenatal support" "pregnancy support group" or "prenatal depression discussion (or support) group." The PANDAS Foundation of the UK offers both online and telephone support for pregnant women and new mothers. The BabyCenter community pages are another good option as well.
Prenatal depression is also called "antenatal" depression, so look for resources using that term as well.
Check out the Antenatal Depression Forum at Netmums. Your hospital or another health agency in your area will likely offer a wide variety of classes designed for new parents. These classes will teach you practical matters, such as how to change a diaper, which will make you feel even more competent moving forward. They also give you the chance to spend time with a group of people who are working through the stages of pregnancy. If you have a partner, spend time doing something that you both enjoy, such as going to a movie. This may help to counter any loneliness that you might feel. It also reinforces the fact that you should approach pregnancy as a team.


Ask your partner for help and tell them that you appreciate what they do. They will likely reciprocate in kind, leading to positive, open communication patterns. You might say, ‚ÄúThank you for hanging those pictures in the nursery, they look really great.‚Äù

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> In order to engage with the Shamanic wisdom of your dreams, you must become ‚Äúawake‚Äù (or ‚Äúlucid‚Äù) while still dreaming. In other words, you must be aware that you are dreaming while you remain asleep. One simple way to induce lucid dreaming is to get into the practice of regularly asking yourself whether or not you are dreaming.


By routinely asking yourself whether or not you are dreaming while you are awake, you will naturally extend this practice while you are asleep.
When you ask yourself this question during a dream, it will be obvious that you are, in fact, dreaming, and your dream will become lucid.
Lucid dreaming is an essential step on path to Shamanic dreaming.
 There are some common signs that can indicate that you are dreaming. Several of these apply to most people, but in time, you will come to recognize those signals most relevant to you. These signals can encourage you to become lucid.


Clocks, phones, and other technological devices will often malfunction.
Your hands will often look bizarre.
Your reflection in a mirror may look strange and different.
Anytime you encounter one of these tip-offs, ask yourself, ‚ÄúAm I dreaming or awake?‚Äù

, Traditional Shamans would regularly use drumming to induce a trace, or dreamlike state. You can tap into this method by listening to binaural beats while you sleep.


Binaural beats are audio tracks, for use with headphones, that play different frequencies in each ear.
These beats induce an almost automatic meditative state, and have been shown to encourage lucid sleep. Once you become effective at ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù in your dreams, it is time to glean deeper messages. You have already been looking for and recognizing personal and archetypal symbols in your dreams. Now it is time to interpret them.


For example, if your grandfather was struck by lighting, lighting may be an important symbol to you. If your grandfather‚Äôs story inspires you, lighting may signify inspiration. If you are terrified of storms because of what happened, lighting may signify fear or caution.
Additionally, lighting can be an archetypal symbol. It is linked to Greek, Norse, and Hindu Gods. It can symbolize punishment from the Gods or loss of innocence.
How did you feel when you encountered lighting in the dream? This can guide your interpretation of the symbol.
Practice this interpretation after you wake from a dream. In time, you will be able to perform this analysis in the midst of the dream.
 Remember the ‚Äúthree levels‚Äù? When you become lucid in a dream, look around and determine which of the three levels you are functioning on.


If you are on the Middle Level, look for a door or passage way. Look for stairs. If you can find any kind of portal, go through it. It will likely lead to an Upper or Lower Level.
If you find yourself on an Upper Level, observe any messages about your connection to the divine, about your quest for knowledge, or about the after life. On this level, you will often be visited by ancestors.
If you find yourself on the Lower Level, observe messages about your primal being. This level can tell you about your deepest needs and desires. On this level, you may be spoken to by animals, or by your unborn children.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Not everyone should get tested for chlamydia, but those at higher risk for the infection should at least once per year. Factors that greatly increase your risk of contracting a chlamydia infection include: having multiple sex partners over the course of a year; not using condoms consistently during sexual encounters; having a history of other sexually transmitted diseases or infections; and being sexually active and younger than 25 years old.Gay and bisexual men have a much greater risk of chlamydia infection compared to heterosexual men.


If you're over 25, consult your doctor for how often you should be screened. Other reasons why you should consider getting tested include: if you have any unusual discomfort or symptoms with your genitalia; if you think a condom ripped during sex; if one of your previous sex partners develops an STI; or if you're planning on getting pregnant.You can get a chlamydia infection by having vaginal, anal or oral sex with someone who is infected. Ejaculation and exchange of semen is not necessary to get infected.
Being in a long-term monogamous relationship with a partner who doesn't have an STI and always using latex condoms during sex are the main ways of reducing your risk (in addition to abstinence, of course).
The early-stages of chlamydia infections rarely cause signs or symptoms, so waiting for them to appear before you get tested is never a good idea. When symptoms do occur, they usually start between 1-3 weeks after the initial exposure to the chlamydia bacteria.The main signs and symptoms associated with chlamydia include: painful urination, lower abdominal cramps, inflamed mucous membranes within the genitalia, smelly discharge from the vagina/penis, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding and testicular pain. Not all symptoms occur together or at all. For men, too, you can experience, mucoid or watery urethral discharge and painful urination.


When signs and symptoms do occur, they're often mild and fade away quickly, which makes it easy to overlook them.
Even if you have no symptoms, you can still pass the infection on to your sex partners.
Although quite unusual, a chlamydia bacterial infection can also cause a low-grade fever.
 There are numerous health complications associated with a chlamydia infection, which is why it's important to get tested and treated right away if you test positive. The most serious complication for women is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which causes pain and scarring in the uterus, ovaries and Fallopian tubes.Severe PID can lead to infertility due to scarring and obstruction within the Fallopian tubes. For men, the most serious complications are painful infections within the scrotum (epididymitis) and prostate gland (prostatitis). Chlamydia can't make men infertile, only women.


People with chlamydia infections are more likely to get other STIs, such as gonorrhea and HIV.
Chlamydia infections in both genders increases the risk of Reiter's syndrome, an inflammatory disease that leads to arthritis and swelling in the eyes and urethra.
Pregnant women with chlamydia can pass the infection to their babies during the birth process, which can lead to pneumonia and/or serious eye infections in newborns.If you have chlamydia, your future pregnancies are at a higher risk for being ectopic (a dangerous condition where the fetus implants outside the uterus).
A chlamydia infection during pregnancy also makes prematurity more likely.
There is also an uncommon condition called Fitzhugh-Curtis Syndrome, where PID evolves into an inflammation of the liver.
 If you are at higher risk for chlamydia or experience symptoms, then schedule an appointment with your doctor or gynecologist. Your doctor will give you an exam and take urine / blood tests to see if you have an infection. Remember that the main symptoms of chlamydia (pain with urination, vaginal / penile discharge) are not specific to chlamydia ‚Äî virtually all STIs and urinary tract infections cause similar symptoms. The correct diagnosis is important because different infections require different treatments (different antibiotic or anti-viral medications).


Many medical organizations recommend chlamydia screening for sexually active women younger that 25 years because the infection is often without symptoms.Testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea is usually done simultaneously as the two infections cause very similar symptoms.Women should not douche or use vaginal medicines for 24 hours prior to having a chlamydia test.
Try not to urinate for about 2 hours prior to having urine collected for chlamydia testing.
Taking antibiotics prior to chlamydia testing may affect the results (hide a positive test).
 The NAAT is the preferred test for chlamydia because it's more sensitive and specific than other tests, can be performed on urine samples from both genders.The NAAT is sensitive to the genetic material (DNA) of chlamydia bacteria ‚Äî the test is able to amplify the DNA from a urine sample, so it's very accurate with a low percentage of false-positive results. Results take 1-2 days to come back from the lab in most cases.


Some medical organizations recommend that all victims of sexual assault get NAAT testing for both chlamydia and gonorrhea infections.
 An older method of diagnosing STIs is by swabbing the vaginal / penile discharge and sending it to the lab to grow a culture.If a bacterial culture grows, the lab tech looks under the microscope to identify which bacteria it is. Viral infections don't grow cultures, but bacterial infections do. Females get their cervix swabbed (which is at the back of the vagina), whereas men get their urethra swabbed (a thin swab is inserted about an inch into the opening of the penis). Results take between 5-7 days to come back from the lab.


Women can get swabbed for chlamydia during a routine Pap test, which checks for cancerous changes in cells.
Some women prefer to swab their own vaginas in privacy, which is fine if they use the same technique the doctor uses ‚Äî a lubricated speculum is typically needed to spread the vagina open.
For men or women who primarily have anal sex, the doctor may swab the anus instead of the genitalia.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Antral follicles are tiny structures that contain immature eggs. A transvaginal ultrasound can be performed to visually assess your antral follicle count (AFC). Determining this count can provide an estimate of the number of remaining eggs present in each of your ovaries.This test is considered more accurate than FSH testing for older women (greater than 44 years old).
Your FSH levels can vary from month to month, while your AFC will remain relatively stable.
 A transvaginal ultrasonic test can also be used to measure your ovarian volume. The size (volume) of your ovaries can also help indicate the number of remaining eggs in your reserve. By measuring your ovaries on three planes and using some calculation, your doctor should be able to determine your ovarian volume.This test alone is not the most accurate indicator of ovarian reserve or fertility.
This information can be useful, however, when placed in conjunction with other results.
 For some women, a combination of biochemical and imaging (ultrasound) techniques can provide the most accurate assessment of their ovarian reserve. Since no single fertility test can boast 100% accuracy, multiple methods are often combined.Discuss this carefully with your healthcare provider, and select the best 1-2 tests for you.
The combination of too many tests can actually cloud results and lead to confusion.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> You can find lots of helpful information here: http://www.lamaze.org/. This website provides access to emailed weekly pregnancy advice, online classes, and tips. The website also describes what to expect from a typical Lamaze class.
 Use Lamaze‚Äôs online locator tool to find a certified instructor close to you: http://www.lamaze.org/FindALamazeChildbirthClass. Once you have your list of potential options and their contact information, speak with several teachers and ask them questions about themselves and the course. You want someone who makes you feel comfortable and open, as they‚Äôll be helping you through an intimate and important process in your life.The locator tool will allow you to search by the name of a specific instructor who may have been recommended to you, or to enter your desired proximity up to 50 miles (80.47 km) away from your zipcode.
 Classes can be held in hospitals, birthing centers, healthcare providers‚Äô offices, homes, or community centers. Lamaze‚Äôs online locator tool lists the locations of various courses along with the instructors. The website also provides a map showing the distances from the course locations to your home. If you‚Äôre taking a weekly class, you may want to prioritize convenience. Be sure, however, that the space you choose is one in which you can relax. Typical Lamaze classes include comprehensive, 12-hour coverage of labor, birth, early baby care, breastfeeding, and healthy lifestyle tips. These classes should also teach you relaxation, breathing, and massage techniques for pain management during labor and delivery. Check to make sure your instructor‚Äôs course plan adheres to these standards.Many expectant mothers appreciate Lamaze for its non-judgmental approach to medical intervention during labor. Lamaze classes will not encourage you to choose one birth plan over another. Lamaze instead fosters confidence and communication skills so that pregnant women can make safe and calm decisions during delivery. It‚Äôs important to ensure that you‚Äôre learning from a person who has the necessary training. Lamaze International offers the only internationally recognized childbirth education certification. If you found your instructor using the Lamaze website, you can rest assured that they‚Äôre fully certified. If you found your instructor on your own, ask the instructor to provide a record of their certification.If you‚Äôre taking your course at a hospital or healthcare provider‚Äôs office, you‚Äôll likely receive instruction from a registered nurse (RN) who has also been certified to teach Lamaze.
 Most Lamaze classes include 12 hours of instruction spread over six weeks in two-hour class sessions. Some instructors may also offer an intensive weekend session of two classes lasting six hours per day.While some expectant mothers might appreciate quickly finishing the course, weekly sessions may be better first-time parents who need time to absorb all the new material. If you are looking to meet other women or couples who are also experiencing pregnancy, a group class may be right for you. These classes will offer less one-on-one instruction, but they will also usually be more affordable. This type of instruction is generally more flexible because the classes are arranged around your needs, and the course may even be held in your home. Private classes will be totally focused on you and your partner, and you can ask any personal questions that you might be afraid to introduce in a group setting. However, this option will almost certainly be more costly. Be sure that your instructor has a maximum class size. Smaller class sizes of no more than 24 students are best. If you‚Äôre able to find a course with 10-12 students, this will provide you with the optimal level of individual and group instruction. Various courses will differ in cost. Popular Lamaze instructors with a well established following may be able to charge more than newer instructors. Smaller classes may also be more expensive than those open to larger groups. Try to balance your needs with your budget. Your loved ones will be familiar with your personality and birthing needs. They‚Äôll be able to provide targeted advice that combines their likes and dislikes of their past Lamaze classes and instructors with what they know about your preferences.Remember to put your desires first. Don‚Äôt allow advice from those who are close to you to drown out what you want from your classes.
 Since Lamaze classes don‚Äôt typically start until you‚Äôre about seven months pregnant, you shouldn‚Äôt worry about scheduling a course as soon as you get pregnant. Your doctor can suggest the appropriate timeline for reaching out to instructors, making your choice, and finalizing your reservation. Consider the course an exciting indicator that you‚Äôve reached your last few months of pregnancy. It‚Äôs important to have a support network in place during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and after you give birth. Choose a partner, friend, or family member and make sure they‚Äôre fully prepared to invest their time and energy in these classes. You can work with them to make sure the classes don‚Äôt clash with their other obligations. Taking this class together will help you both build a relationship of trust you can rely on when it counts.Be sure to ask instructors whether they expect and allow partner participation.
 Your instructor will likely offer a variety of options to fit their students‚Äô scheduling needs. Try to pick a time that doesn‚Äôt clash with other events on your schedule, as you don‚Äôt want your classes to feel like an obligation.Most instructors will expect that at least some of their students work during the weekdays, and they should be prepared with several options to fit into a full-time work schedule.
 Once you‚Äôve decided on a course, contact the instructor and reserve your spot. They may send you some paperwork to sign, and they may require payment in part or in full when you make your reservation. Summary: "

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Dispense a dollop of light hair mousse into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together to spread it, then work the mousse into your hair, moving from the bottom up.


Use a light mousse, not a heavy one. You'll be using the mousse to make your hair fuller and easier to manipulate, so it doesn't need to hold your hair in place.
If you don't have mousse, work with hair that hasn't been washed in a full 24 hours. The oils from your scalp should have coated your hair during this time, giving it more structure and making it easier to shape than freshly washed hair.
Use a comb to draw a curved line from temple to temple. Tie back the bottom portion of hair using a hair band.The line should gradually curve upward from one temple, then curve downward as it reaches the other temple. The highest part of the curve should be the back center of your head, and it should be nearly high enough to reach your natural part.
When creating the victory rolls, you'll only work with the top portion of hair. Tying back the bottom portion can keep it out of your way and make it easier to complete the rolls.
 Use your comb to create a straight, deep side part.


If you have side-swept bangs, section your hair so that the part lands on the opposite side of your bangs. If you don't have bangs, draw the part on either side.
You'll work with the smaller of these two sections first, so it might be a good idea to clip or loosely tie back the larger section until you're ready for it.
 Separate the smaller section of hair into three sub-sections. Tease the top and middle thirds along the underside of the hair, then tease the bottom third along the top of the hair.


Use a standard comb or boar bristled teasing brush while teasing your hair.
Hold the hair taut with one hand. Using your other hand, brush upward along the sub-section, moving closer to the scalp. Start approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the scalp and work along the length of each sub-section in 3-inch (7.6-cm) intervals.
 Release the larger side of hair, then separate it into five sub-sections. Tease the top four sub-sections along the underside, then tease the bottom fifth along the top side.


Follow the same teasing procedure for this larger side as you followed for the smaller side.
Note that you're still only working with the top section of hair; the bottom section should remain tied back in a ponytail.
 Form a line of bobby pins along both sides of the part. Position the pins roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the part.


Start each line at the back of the part. Lay the pins from end-to-end, continuing until you nearly reach the front of your forehead. Stop at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) away from your forehead.
This step isn't strictly necessary, but following it will create a base for your victory rolls, which may make it easier to shape them correctly.
 Gather together the hair along the small side of your part. Bring the ends over and around to the top, forming a loop. Continue rolling over this loop until you reach your row of bobby pins.To create the right shape and width, position two fingers roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the ends of the hair and roll the ends around them. Tuck in the ends to keep the roll tidy. Continue rolling toward your scalp, keeping it as neat as possible the entire time.
Alternatively, you can roll the section around a 1-inch (2.5-cm) curling iron instead of your fingers. Doing so can produce a smoother, neater roll.
 Gently remove your fingers or curling iron from the center of the roll, then slide a bobby pin into the roll through the front to hold it together. Insert a second bobby pin through the back of the roll to make it more secure.


Secure both bobby pins through the bottom of the roll and into the hair lying directly along your scalp.
Right now, the roll should look like a small "o" with a hollow center.
 Use your hand to gently flatten the back of the roll, closing it off. Pin the bottom of the roll in place using another bobby pin or two.


If necessary, shape the front of the roll during this step as well, making it as rounded as possible.
You can use more bobby pins to help hold the shape of the roll, but make sure that each one remains hidden somewhere within the roll itself.
 Cover all sides of the first victory roll with hairspray to help hold the final shape.


Cover your unrolled hair with one of your hands to prevent the hairspray from soaking into it too much.
It's best to spray down each roll individually instead of waiting until you complete both. By spraying the first roll now, you'll protect it from possible disturbances as you work on the shape of the second roll.
 Gather the hair together along the larger side of your part. Follow the same steps to create another victory roll from this portion of hair.


Roll the hair, pin the roll down, shape the roll, and apply hairspray.
Note that this roll can be more difficult to complete than the first since you'll be working with more hair. Be patient and work slowly.
When finished, the two rolls should be mirrored side-by-side down the length of your part. The victory rolls are complete, but you'll still need to style the bottom portion of hair previously tied back.
 Untie the bottom portion of your hair. Comb it out, working the brush straight down until your hair seems smooth again.


Unless your hair was wavy or curly before you began, this bottom section will likely seem out of place with your victory rolls. There are several ways to create a matching style, but the simplest is to leave the lower section down and give a loose, wavy curl.
 Use a 2-inch to 3-inch (5-cm to 7.6-cm) curling iron to curl large sections of your remaining, loose hair. Work around your entire head until you achieve a result you feel pleased with.The waves or curls of this section should spiral down vertically. Do not curl the hair in horizontal sections.
To give the look a little more pizzazz, form tighter curls toward the ends of each section. You can use your curling iron for this, or you can make the curls more pronounced by accentuating them with a round hair brush.
 Cover your face and spray your entire head of hair with more hairspray. Use enough spray to help hold both the rolls and your loose-hanging waves/curls.


If your hair looks frizzy at this point, you can also use a small amount of hair cream or serum to help tame the frizz and create a smoother style.
 You can leave the victory rolls as they are, or you can give the look even more retro, feminine flair by highlighting them with a flower or bow.


For best results, use a bow or flower hair ornament attached to a hair clip.
Position the accessory on the side with the smaller victory roll to keep the look balanced. Slide the hair clip into the flat hair toward the front of your face and just above your ear. The ornament should not grab into the hair used to complete the victory roll itself.
 Give your victory rolls a final check in a mirror and touch them up as needed. Once you're satisfied with how they look, you should be ready to show off your new victory rolls out in public.

Your body will let you know when it's tired, and when you return to bed you may find it easier to fall asleep. Music can have a powerful effect on the brain, and if you're feeling overly excited you may find it helpful to listen to soothing music.If you have a particular album that always calms you down, try listening to it in the dark.
Listen to a recording of natural sounds, like rainfall or ocean waves, which can create the illusion of a calm, natural environment.
Try listening to a sad song. Research suggests that sad music can actually leave listeners feeling soothed and even uplifted, which may help curb the restlessness that's keeping you awake. While some people find that the adrenaline boost from vigorous exercise wakes them up, most people sleep better after working out. Exercise helps release stress and can make you feel calmer, which can add up to a restful night of sleep. There are many different types and styles of meditation, but choosing the right one for you can be a rewarding and calming experience. If you're too wound up to fall asleep, try engaging in yoga or meditation to stop your mind from racing and help relax your body.Focus on your breath. Take deep breaths in and slowly exhale. Rhythmic breathing slows down your heart rate and can help you disengage from stressful thought patterns. Focus all of your attention on your body, beginning with your toes and working your way up to your head. This can help you distract your mind from thinking about whatever is keeping you awake. If you have things to do or a brilliant idea on your mind to tackle later, make a note so you won't focus on it while trying to sleep. It's no help to you trying to remember all those undone tasks, and dwelling on them at night might prevent you from getting a good night's sleep. A shower will also help you relax, but soaking in a bathtub relaxes the muscles better, and researchers have found that lying in a bath can have positive psychological results.Whether bathing or showering, the hot water can help calm your mind and relax your body.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> You may be dying to be back with your ex-boyfriend, but the worst thing you can do is hang around him incessantly, call him, or wink at him in class until he gets the picture. If you're always around, he probably does get the picture, but it won't be one that he likes. Instead, you should take a breather and stop hanging around him, at least for a few weeks or longer.


You can decide whether you want to cut off contact completely, or if that's impossible because of school.
Stop calling or texting him. Even if you think of something funny that reminds you of him, it's better to hold off.
Try to avoid seeing him at all, even when you're hanging out with mutual friends. If you do catch yourselves at the same party, you don't have to be rude to him, but you shouldn't spend too much time talking to him.
You don't have to be rude to take a break from your ex. If you do run into him, you don't have to run away, but you don't have to linger and talk about nothing either.
While you distance yourself from your boyfriend, you'll be in a good position to reflect on the problems in the relationship. If you want to get your man back, then you have to figure out what it was that went wrong, so you don't do it all over again. The problem could be simple, or it could take a bit longer to figure out. Here are some of the things that could have gone wrong:


Maybe you were too jealous or controlling, and he couldn't handle it anymore.
Maybe you didn't spend enough time together.
Maybe he felt like you weren't caring or affectionate enough.
Maybe he felt like you were too clingy and were always around.
Maybe there was a situational change, like one of you having to move to a different town, or maybe he was leaving for college in just a few months and wanted to break it off.
Maybe you were just always fighting and didn't get along.
 Once you figure out what went wrong in the relationship - which could be a combination of problems instead of just one - it's time to think about how you can make things different next time. You don't want to make your ex-boyfriend want you back if you'll just run into the same problems and drama all over again.


You need to work on making some big changes, whether it's controlling an aspect of your personality that led to the downfall of the relationship, or to think about how you can change the dynamics of the relationship if it started again.
If the problem was that you were jealous, you need to think about how you can be less jealous.
If he thought you were too bossy or controlling, you need to tone down that aspect of your personality.
If you fought all the time, you can think about how you can be less combative.
If the problem had to do more with him, then you can think about how you can be together again without this issue -- maybe he'll be willing to change. But if he's not willing to change and you know this will be an issue long term, then you should consider whether or not it's worth it to get him back.
 Take some time to work out whatever problem may have ended your relationship, and just spend time enjoying your own company or hanging out with friends. Make a list of three flaws that you'd like to change about yourself, and slowly start to address them. It takes a lifetime to grow as a person, but even taking small steps to become your ideal steps can help your relationship.


If you have some quality "me time," your ex will start to wonder where you are. If you're busy focusing on yourself, that will make him think about you even more.
Spend time with your girlfriends, working out, or pursuing your favorite hobbies.
Take some time to work on yourself, but not too much time. If you spend months addressing your issues and completely fall out of the picture, your ex may have moved on.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Uterine fibroids are benign growths inside the uterus. These benign tumors are muscular and grow within the wall of the uterus. There can be a single tumor or many. They can be as small as an apple seed or grow larger than a grapefruit.A hysterectomy may be necessary to remove large fibroids.


Uterine fibroids may have a negative effect on your ability to become pregnant. Uterine fibroids may also cause excessive bleeding.
Uterine fibroids may cause anemia due to excess blood loss during your period. As a result, you may require iron supplements or a blood transfusion. If you are diagnosed with cancer of the uterus, cervix, or ovaries, then your physician may recommend that you have a hysterectomy. A hysterectomy will help to remove the cancer cells in your reproductive organs, which may improve the effectiveness of other treatments.
 Endometriosis causes the tissue that grows inside the uterus to begin growing on the surrounding tissues in the abdomen, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, the area between the vagina and rectum, the outer surface of the uterus, and the ligaments that support the uterus. A hysterectomy may be required to stop the excess tissue growth.Tissue may also grow on the cervix, vulva, bladder, bowel, and in abdominal surgical scars.
If left untreated, endometriosis may cause lesions, inflammation, pain, scar tissue, infertility, and bowel problems.
 Abnormal vaginal bleeding is often the result of an underlying medical condition. Some causes of abnormal bleeding include fibroids, cancer, infection, changes in hormone levels, endometriosis, Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS), Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), sexual abuse, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes.


Depending upon the underlying condition and whether it can be controlled with medication or lifestyle changes, your physician may recommend a hysterectomy to prevent excessive blood loss each month. Uterine prolapse means that the uterus or womb has sagged or slipped out of its normal position. After diagnosis, your physician may recommend a surgical option of either a hysterectomy or uterine suspension. In a uterine suspension, the uterus is put back in place and suspended with a sling like apparatus or reattached to the back of the uterus.When a prolapse happens, the uterus may even drop partway through the vagina. This creates a lump or bulge.
 Adenomyosis affects the inner lining of the uterus, also known as the endometrium. Adenomyosis can cause severe menstrual cramping, lower abdominal pressure, bloating, and heavy periods. The condition can affect the entire uterus or just one spot.


Even though adenomyosis not life-threatening, the condition can have a negative effect on a woman‚Äôs quality of life. Hysterectomy is one of the options for treating adenomyosis.Hysterectomy is often the best choice for this condition, but it can be delayed if you wish to have more children.
 A hysterectomy may be necessary to remove polyps if they are too large to be removed using dilation and curettage. Polyps can develop in the lining of the uterus and cause irregular bleeding. Polyps are not often cancerous and can often be removed through the vagina when they are near the opening of the cervix.If your doctor has recommended a hysterectomy to remove polyps, ask if performing a dilation and curettage may be possible instead.

Be aware of the risks of HRT and consult with your doctor prior to deciding to pursue this option. HRT can increase your risk of heart disease, breast cancer, uterine cancer, and stroke. While the efficacy of some of these in providing relief from menopausal symptoms is contested, you could still try an alternative therapy to manage your symptoms.Black cohosh might be effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms. It has not, however, been shown to improve symptoms. If you would like to use this herb to relieve symptoms like hot flashes, do so only in the short-term (six-months maximum), as long-term efficacy and safety are still contested.Phytoestrogens may be helpful in providing relief from menopausal symptoms. They are estrogens that occur in some plants and have the effect of slowing cell growth and preventing inflammation. They are found in a variety of foods and are also widely available as supplements. You may want to moderately complement your diet with phytoestrogens and keep track of any symptoms which are alleviated.

While the safety of phytoestrogens which occur naturally in food is practically uncontested, this is not the case for non-food phytoestrogens. The risks of long-term use of non-food phytoestrogens are unknown.Try herbal preparations. There are a number of herbs which you could try using to alleviate menopausal symptoms, though the efficacy of these is unknown. These include evening primrose, ginkgo, red clover, chaste-tree berry, and ginseng. Consult with your doctor if you experience any unusual pains or sensations or if you find any of your symptoms to be unbearable. Furthermore, if symptoms such as hot flashes, mood changes, or heavy bleeding during or between periods are interfering with your day to day life, see your doctor.You should see your doctor for a full physical exam (including a breast exam, a pelvic exam, and a mammogram) once a year.

A movie that he is very excited to watch might mean he wants to focus more on the movie than on kissing you. If he chooses a movie he does not seem excited about, he might have chosen it so he can kiss you during the movie.


If he has seen the movie before, he might want to kiss you more than pay attention to the movie.
He might be hoping the movie sparks your interest in kissing him if he chooses a romantic movie.Keep in mind that the movie he chooses might not necessarily be an indicator if he wants to kiss you or not.
If he suggests somewhere to sit, it might be an indicator of whether he wants to kiss you or not. Kissing might not be the first thing on his mind if he wants to sit right in the front or next to a group of people. He might be thinking about kissing you if he suggests you sit in the back or in an isolated corner.If you are hoping to kiss him, you can suggest sitting in the back if he doesn‚Äôt: ‚ÄúThere are a lot of empty seats in the back. Let‚Äôs sit over there!‚Äù

, If he does not get food, he might be worried about it getting in the way of kissing you or making his breath smell bad. However, sharing food can spark physical contact and break barriers. Sharing food might lead to accidentally touching hands when reaching for the popcorn or breaking germ barriers when sharing a soda.Eating together can also make you become more comfortable around each other and make you both less nervous.
 A guy might be interested in kissing you if he is being playful with you and giving you compliments. He will probably talk to you before the movie starts and might try to initiate conversation and flirty commentary during the movie too.


Whispering and getting close to your ear when he talks is a sign he might want to kiss.He might say something complimentary: ‚ÄúYou look very pretty in your dress!‚Äù
He might make funny comments about the previews or the movie to make you laugh: ‚ÄúWow! That horror movie looks like a great movie to bring my baby sister to!‚Äù

, What he is looking at during the movie can be a sign if he is trying to kiss you. Looking at you during the movie, especially at your eyes or lips, it is a good sign he wants to kiss. Looking into your eyes a lot could mean he is about to kiss you.


Watch his facial expressions and see if he seems happy or nervous. This could mean he wants to kiss you.If he is giving you sideways glances and turning away quickly, he probably wants to kiss. Where he is sitting in his chair can be a sign if he wants to kiss you. If he is sitting as close to you as he can or is resting his legs and feet on yours, he might want to kiss. If he is completely leaned over toward the opposite direction as you, he probably does not want to kiss. If he is holding your hand, has his arm around you, or is resting his hand on your leg, he probably wants to kiss you. He might not be trying to kiss you if he keeps his hands to himself or is more focused on eating snacks than on you. It does not necessarily mean he wants to kiss if he is chewing gum or has a breath mint, but it might be a sign. This could show he is preparing himself to kiss you and wants it to go well. Some guys might be really scared to kiss you, even if they want to. If he seems nervous and is sweating a lot and looking down and away from you often, he might be too scared to kiss you.

 Discuss with them about the rumor. Ask if they are also aware of it.
 When rumors spread, people expect you to act differently. And if you do act differently, people kind of start believing that yes, something going around about this person seems to be true, because she is behaving differently, after all.
 And address this large collection of people. You can probably start off by saying," I have become aware of the fact that certain things are going around.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> The dramatic person wants attention, and by participating in whatever crisis she's attempting to drag you into, you‚Äôre feeding that need. If you resist this, and refuse to engage with her, you can short-circuit the whole situation and possibly diffuse the drama.If the dramatic person starts up, simply tell her outright that you won‚Äôt be putting up with it. You can do so firmly without also being rude or harsh. Say something like, ‚ÄúListen, I know you‚Äôre upset, but I really can‚Äôt get involved.‚Äù
Instead, give the person the attention and validation she is seeking only when she is engaging in more positive behavior (i.e. talking about positive topics, asking about others, etc.). Do not provide any attention, reaction, validation, or interest in drama-related topics (i.e. complaining, gossip, negative self-talk, etc.).
If this is a classmate or a co-worker that you can‚Äôt get away from, the next best thing you can do is try to divert his attention. If he is upset and being dramatic, try to shift his attention and energy to something else. Suggest something else you can talk about or focus on. You can try to turn the problem he is having back on him, rather than allowing him to blame you or put the burden on you.Even if the dramatic person is having a fit, you can still avoid engaging with him by simply changing the subject. Say something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre upset. Did you want to go get some lunch?‚Äù That way, you‚Äôve acknowledged him, but not allowed the issue to go any further.
 Physically remove yourself from the situation, if you can. Leave, walk away, or go to another room. If you can‚Äôt leave or walk away, put some emotional distance between you and the dramatic person instead. Disconnect yourself from the problems she is causing, and focus on something else.


Excusing yourself politely is one way to leave her to her own issues. Say something like, ‚ÄúI really wish I could help, but I have an appointment.‚Äù Or, you could be direct with her and say, ‚ÄúI wish I could help, but I need a little space right now.‚Äù, If the person is throwing a fit about something, get him to talk about the actual thing that‚Äôs upsetting him, rather than just about how it‚Äôs making him feel. This will help him keep from spiraling into an emotional rampage. Ask him to tell you exactly what happened, and focus on that.Use simple questions to keep him on track. Ask something like, ‚ÄúWhat do you think you could do about this to make it better?‚Äù
Redirecting his focus away from his emotions is a good way to keep from engaging with his dramatics. Instead, you‚Äôre urging him to approach things from a more level-headed and less dramatic perspective.
 You might feel the need to ‚Äúfix‚Äù or help her, but it‚Äôs not your problem or responsibility. These people thrive on attention and others feeling pity for them. You won‚Äôt be able to change the person, so don‚Äôt make it your problem to do so.It‚Äôs important to remember to let these kinds of people figures themselves out on their own. They will have to come to their own understanding of their problems and how to solve them, and you can‚Äôt be held responsible for the outcome.
 Dealing with a dramatic person can be extremely exhausting, especially if you give him a lot of time, focus, and energy. Even if the person is a friend, don‚Äôt be afraid to limit the time you‚Äôre willing to spend dealing with his problems. Setting this kind of boundary is important for you and your own sanity, but also for the other person to become more self-reliant.If the dramatic person begins to have a meltdown or outburst, say something like, ‚ÄúI only have a few minutes, so try and tell me the facts.‚Äù This will hopefully redirect his emotion and also limit the amount of time you‚Äôll be engaged with the issue.
 Sometimes, the best way to handle a dramatic person is to tell her outright that you aren‚Äôt interested in dealing with drama. It might seem harsh, but it‚Äôs a quick and painless way to get right to the point and avoid the issue altogether.You have to think of your own best interests, and dealing with dramatic people can be emotionally draining and stressful. It‚Äôs not a bad thing to need to step away from a person who stresses you out, and it‚Äôs okay to tell her exactly why you‚Äôre walking away.
 Some people who are chronically dramatic, even over the smallest things, may actually suffer from a personality or mood disorder. This is usually a more extreme case, and is more likely when the severely dramatic behavior shows up in all aspects of his life.Some dramatic people may have personality disorders or mood disorders in which they tend to over exaggerate problems and are prone to attention-seeking behaviors.Even if the dramatic person you‚Äôre dealing with does suffer from a mental health problem, remember that it‚Äôs still not your job or responsibility to fix or cure him. If the drama seems to be a real, critical problem, you might suggest that he seek therapy or counseling.
 Some people who grow up to become drama queens and kings suffered from some kind of neglect as a child. These people may have had parents who ignored them, or brushed off their problems. In turn, they resorted to acting out or behaving dramatically just to get the attention they craved.There is even a link to other types of childhood trauma, including things like surviving a natural disaster or dealing with abuse. These things could also ultimately lead to a young person or adult who seeks attention through acting out or behaving dramatically.
 The primary goal of drama queens and kings is to get attention. By blowing small problems out of proportion and over exaggerating their feelings and emotions, the person is hoping to pull other people in and receive attention, sympathy, or pity. It‚Äôs your choice, in the end, if you choose to give in and give her attention, or to walk away and not let her affect you.You might even notice that these drama kings and queens don‚Äôt seem to care about your input, unless you‚Äôre validating them or encouraging their behavior. Giving the person genuine advice, urging her to calm down, or insisting the problem isn‚Äôt that big might just result in her getting more upset.

Highlight the low risk of infection,hepatitis, and nerve damage as the main concerns.Emphasize that these complications can be prevented by using a certified, licensed piercer,ensuring you have the proper immunizations for tetanus and hepatitis B,and by regularly cleaning the ring and the piercing. Mention that noticeable swelling is an expected aftereffect of a lip piercing, and that to make room for the enlarged area, a longer-than-usual piercing called a post is put in place until the swelling goes down. But add that while the larger post can cause gum damage, its potential to do so is limited since it will be replaced by a regular-size piercing after the swelling goes away in six to eight weeks.Try to play down the change in appearance by observing: "It won't look or feel much different from a fat lip after a sports accident, or a mouth sore."

, If your parents say that they‚Äôve heard that lip piercings can damage your teeth by chipping them, point out that it is actually tongue piercings that cause the most tooth chipping.While there may be a slight risk of tooth damage while eating, depending on the type of lip ring you wear, you can calm any concerns your parents may have by agreeing to remove your ring before meals once the piercing has healed.

Do you have a trusted aunt, uncle or grandparent with whom you could discuss your situation? Do you think your high school guidance counselor could offer you some advice? If you don‚Äôt feel like you could talk to other adults because you‚Äôre afraid they‚Äôd end up siding with your parents and agreeing that you currently have the correct limits placed on you, that might indicate that your parents actually are being fair. If that‚Äôs the case, you need to be honest with yourself.
 You‚Äôll feel better after writing down your thoughts without fear of offending anyone, and you‚Äôll be able to reread your journal over time to see how well you are following your parents‚Äô rules and behaving in a mature manner.


Your journal will provide a written history of how you and your parents are negotiating your rules. If you are truly following their guidelines and behaving as they want you to, you will be able to show them that you've kept your word. This will allow you to produce evidence for your argument and help you prove that they can trust you with more freedom.
 Consider why the rules are in place and what your parents believe those rules are accomplishing.If you had a teenaged daughter, would you allow her to go to a party at a friend‚Äôs house with no adults around? Would you allow your 14-year-old daughter to go on dates with no adult supervision? Your parents were once the age you are now, and it‚Äôs very possible that they got away with behavior that they don‚Äôt want you to repeat.
If you can‚Äôt see any reason for the rules, ask your parents to explain them. For instance, you could say, "I know you want to keep me safe, but I was wondering why you think allowing me to go to a movie on a Friday night would be putting me in a dangerous situation." They might have reasons that they‚Äôve never mentioned to you or that you haven‚Äôt considered, and you might be able to ease some of their fears.
For example, if you want to attend a movie with a group of friends but your parents are afraid someone might pose a threat to you, you could say "I understand your fears, but I would be with a group of girls my age, and we'd be in public the whole time. If anyone was threatening us, we'd call for help and leave that situation."
Remember that your parents have a reason for their rules. Even if their rules seem unreasonable, your parents put them in place because they want to protect you, and the reason they want to protect you is because they love you. Someday you might thank them for it.
 You‚Äôll be out on your own someday, and you‚Äôll be free to make your own rules. Even if your parents‚Äô are placing ridiculous limitations on your behavior, you will be an adult soon. If you have no choice but to suffer through this period of your life, you can use this time as an opportunity to learn discipline and patience.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Communication is easier than ever with the onslaught of cell phones and social media outlets. While this is not necessarily a bad things, as people are becoming increasingly social and more connected, it has changed the way we communicate and what information we expect to know about others.Communication used to be confined to certain times and places, but with social media and cell phones we can stay in touch with loved ones wherever and whenever we want. We've come to expect an onslaught of information immediately.Social media fuels nosiness in that it invites certain questions. Posting online about your job, travel plans, interpersonal relationships, and your own emotional state fuels curiosity. If your parents are already nosy, consider either blocking them on social media or using filtered settings to limit what information they can see.
Is there a reason your parents are particularly nosy about you and your behavior? Are they equally invested in your siblings and other relatives? If not, there might be a reason they're focusing their attention on you.


You might not be communicating effectively. Oftentimes, people think they're being as open and honest as ever but due to communication barriers they are not fully aware of they've recently changed how they communicate. Has there been a sudden change in your situation? Are you busier than you used to be? More stressed? Dealing with more information than usual? If there's been any change to your situation, you might be putting up communication barriers that are making your parents push for more information.
Has there been a major life change recently? New babies, marriages, divorces, and moving from place to place triggers parental nosiness. While your parents might think they're being helpful with their constant questions, it may read as nosy to you.
 Your parents might not think of themselves as nosy. Many people simply have a greater need for communication and are more open about their own lives, emotions, and needs and expect the same in return.


Some people are compulsive communicators. This means they talk and ask questions because they don't know any other way to interact, and quiet time makes them nervous.People with anxiety issues often talk more without realizing it. If your parents are the nervous type, this might be a habit they picked up over time to deal with excess stress. Knowing exactly what's going on and nitpicking for information provides temporary relief from anxiety inducing thoughts.Extroverts communicate in a different way. While it's a myth that extroverts are bad listeners or that they talk too much, if your parents are far on the extrovert side of the scale they're more likely to try and draw out information by asking leading questions. They're not trying to be rude or nosy. This is simply how they process information. Summary: "

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> For best results, it's ideal to start at least two weeks before the concert you want to attend is scheduled, and the longer in advance you prepare, the better.
Write down (or print out) where the concert is taking place, how much it costs to go, when it is happening, and who is performing.
 The more they know about it, the more comfortable they will feel about you being there.
 However, discuss the concert with your folks before you buy the ticket, because if they say no after you've bought one, then you might be stuck with an expensive ticket you can't even use!

, Get clear written directions if you have never been there before. The important thing is who will be driving you there and back. Your parents will feel better letting you go if the driver is a reliable, respectable person. As a rule of thumb, the older the driver is, the happier your parents will be.
 (Make sure the driver knows this too!) It may seem dorky, but consider asking your parents to drive you. Riding a bus or other public transportation would work well too.
 Try to make sure your friends don't look too scary when they first meet your parents, and get them to act polite.
 You're safer together than you would be alone.
 Your parents may want you to "earn" the trip to the concert. So if you don't get along well with your parents, make sure your behavior is very good for at least a week before you mention the concert. Be considerate. Do chores without being asked more than once, say "please" and "thank you," smile, and tell them a little about how your day at school was.
 The concert is your time to have fun, but consider choosing an outfit that is reasonably modest and low-key. Your parents don't want you to attract "the wrong kind of attention." Remember, the music will be just as good no matter what you're wearing.
 Mosh pits are actually somewhat dangerous, and your parents may not want you near one. Tell your parents you won't go in the mosh pit, and they will be more likely to say yes to the concert. (But don't say it unless you mean it.)

, Play one or two of their more positive songs, tell your parents about the band's great charity work in Africa, and so on. Be truthful, but show the band in the best possible light. Explain why seeing them live is so important to you.
 Again, your parents like to know where you are and what you're up to, and knowing you'll be home at a certain time gives them assurance.
 You won't be able to hear it ring during the show, but you will be able to keep in touch with your family if there is a problem. Call your parents after the concert, when you're leaving to come home.It would be better to text during the concert.

¬†Talking to a friend when you're worried about love is probably the best next step They can help you with advice and they may give their own thoughts and opinions. Always trust your best friend. They may even know your crush well and can help you with ideas to ask them out- but always make sure you're happy about the decision. While it's natural to want other people to share our outlook, it's not realistic because people are diverse and hold different perspectives about all things in life. Don't worry about other people, just about your own self and about your crush. And even with your crush, don't worry too much because either this person is going to be the right one for you or they're not, and if they're not, then who cares what they think?

Another way to look at this is to think how much you'd regret not asking out your crush. This can help you to realize how much this matters to you and how important it is to at least try.
 Before you even get the answer, accept that the answer could be anything from an enthusiastic yes to a shy "thanks but no thanks". No matter what it is, acknowledge how brave it is of you to try this at all. And remind yourself that if you don't ask, you'll never know and for all you know, you could end up with your crush!, That lesson is that you are allowing a fear to hold you back from doing something you really care about. In life, you get what you are courageous enough to ask for. Lean in and get ready to that thing that both excites and scares you!

Prepare ahead what you want to say, so that you don't feel confused or at a loss for words.
Visualize asking out your crush and responding to the different possible ways that your crush might respond, so that you may take their answer with grace.
For help on knowing how to ask out your crush, see How to Ask Out Your Crush.
 This allows a safe space for both of you to react in your own ways without feeling overwhelmed by the stares and ears of other people. It will reduce your feelings of embarrassment and gives you a safety outlet of knowing only your crush is hearing what you have to say. It is also nicer for them, as they have the same safety valve should they feel shy, awkward or uncomfortable too. Do remember that they might be finding this as embarrassing as you!, While this is a very exciting and scary moment for you, it is important to stay calm so that you don't blurt everything out and sound muddled or don't make sense. Breathe deeply and consciously, preparing yourself to say what you have to say. You've already practiced this part if you followed the suggestion above. Thus, it should be easy to know what to say even if it feels hard to say it. Once again, if you followed the suggestion above, you'll already have rehearsed your own reaction to possible responses, so rely on those to say whatever needs to be said.

The first time you see each other you will have an immediate physical attraction. The second time you see each other, you might smile at one another if the attraction is mutual. The third time you may finally start a conversation.Humans enjoy familiarity so the more you create a sense of familiarity, the more you create a sense of attraction.
 Location plays a role in developing an attraction because it can indicate shared interests. For example, if you are constantly seeing each other at the gym, it signals that you both keep fitness as a priority. Be careful not to overdo your interactions. It will quickly become obvious if you are going out of your way to see him. It also allows you to build intrigue and desire if you leave him wanting more after each interaction.
 In the initial stages of interaction, it‚Äôs often difficult to know his schedule. Get on his radar once you know a little about his interests and schedule. Invite him to join you or inquire when he will be at a location next rather than relying on fait.You can also ask mutual acquaintances or drop hints as to where you will be to see if he picks up and joins you.
 Men enjoy the thrill of the chase. If you make it obvious that you will do anything to see him and hang on his every movement, you will be less attractive than if you present yourself as independent and mysterious. Feign surprise when you run into him, even if you had it planned. Summary: "

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> This is usually best if you're interested in going out again. You do not need to gush about what a great time you had, but just send something simple. For example, "I had a great time with you yesterday. Hope we can do it again soon!"There's no need to wait the customary three days, as this is no longer considered dating gospel. You can send the text when you get home from the date or the next day.
 You should only do this if the two of you already follow each other on social media. Try replying to tweets or posting on their Facebook a little bit more if you're interested in them. This can show you've been thinking of them and would like to go out again.If you don't already interact with them online, however, suddenly adding them on Facebook may seem like a bit much.
 If you want to see them again, say so. Do not wait too long, as this can feel like playing games. In a day or two, send a text that says something like, "When are you free?

After about 24 hours, send a polite text saying something like, "I had a really great time meeting you, but I just didn't feel a connection. Sorry.", Unfortunately, sometimes the other person does not feel the same way about you. If someone turns you down for a second date, try to accept it with grace.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Whatever your circumstances, there has to be one main, stand-out reason. Whether that person just isn't right for you or if you're just not ready, be honest with yourself and develop your own reasoning for not wanting to date. That way, you'll be in a good position to explain yourself and won't feel as if you have to give false reasons to accept or avoid dating.
At some point in time, you may meet a person and think that you could possibly develop feelings for them as you're getting to know each other. Be honest with yourself about what you want, and whether or not you're ready to become emotionally intimate with another person. Either way, you can become friends with this person at a later point in time when you may be ready for a relationship.


You may find that the friendship you've shared so far will add depth and meaning to your relationship. But, if you do not intend or want it to ever blossom into an intimate relationship, that's okay, too. Being honest with that person about your expectations for the relationship and your intentions is the best thing you can do, but remember to use your words appropriately.
Use the 'Golden Rule' when deciding how to tell someone you're not interested.
 Sometimes you'll get that annoying question: "Why are you, or why do you choose to be single?" Be prepared to answer it in a way you feel comfortable with, but don't feel as though you have to answer in detail. Something simple like: "I want some time to discover myself," or "I don't need a relationship to be content," works fine, too. But not having even a simple explanation can make the interested person feel as though they have a fatal flaw. And even if that is the case, there's no reason to tear that person apart.
 Spend time with friends and family or gain a new hobby/invest more time in a current one. You'll learn that you are capable of doing activities that you enjoy on your own.


When you are ready to date and get into a relationship, you'll have your own interests to keep you busy in your partner's absence, or you'll have a great passion to share with them. Remember that you are your own person!

, The bonus is that these people will likely share more interests with you; the downside is that you may feel compelled to connect romantically. However, there is no universal law saying that you must be in a relationship with someone you share interests with. Instead, take this opportunity to make some great friends and do some serious networking, especially if you see this hobby turning into a career path.
 Being friendly and being flirty can sometimes be perceived as the same thing, but you should never let someone make you feel guilty or pressured into a relationship because they misread your signals. But also be clear to the interested person about your intentions at that point so that they cannot further misread your signals. If they continue to be persistent and you're not interested, it's probably time to ask yourself if the friendship is worth putting effort into.


If you find yourself in a situation where you've been asked on a date, and don't feel ready to, make it clear to the interested person that you don't want to be in a relationship. Turn them down politely, with a legitimate reason, otherwise you risk hurting their feelings--especially if you want to be friends. Or, instead of declining a date for the two of you, you could suggest inviting friends to join your activity together. Be clear though that it is not a date, and make sure the interested person understands your intentions.
 If they like you as a person, then nothing should have changed in your relationship. If they get mad or upset with you, remember; it's not your fault! Try leaving them alone for a few days so that they can cool off. If they care for you and understand you, they will not let it affect your friendship. Try not to scared away easily. You can still remain friends after turning someone down, but you should always be sensitive to whether or not the other person is willing to continue the friendship, despite their intimate feelings towards you.


Don't pressure them or make them feel guilty about maintaining the friendship if they are uncomfortable with only remaining friends.
If you sense a person is starting to take an interest in you, make sure that you are clear from the start that nothing more than a friendship will be possible. Do not lead them on to stroke your own ego because that can definitely hurt any chances of remaining friends. But don't apologize for being friendly either. Some people may misinterpret friendly behavior as interest, which is why it's important to be clear about your intentions using both verbal language and body language.
Don't stay friends with people who persistently ask you out if you don't feel ready. If you remain friends with such people, you are likely going to end up committing yourself or hurting the other person.
 It's okay if dating isn't number one in your priority list. Just have fun and enjoy life to the fullest. Sometimes it's great to be single!

, You of all people know what you're ready for, and feeling pressured to find a mate can be emotionally draining. Tell your close friends and family members about your choice to stay single and your reasoning behind it so that they don't continue to harass you. Otherwise, those people may assume to know your reasoning, which can complicate things even further.
 If you had a traumatic experience that has influenced your choice to stay single, do not bear the weight of that incident alone. Reach out to trusted family and friends to help you work through what happened, and/or see a therapist or psychiatrist. Keeping a private journal can also help you work through the experience and overcome it, but do not be fooled: unresolved traumatic experiences can fester over time and create new or worsening problems like anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Do some research to find the best options for your recovery so that you can live a more enjoyable and peaceful life.
 Don't forget that there are three outcomes to any intimate relationship: marriage, long-term commitment, or a breakup. Don't date unless you feel prepared for any of the above scenarios. Don't let society's expectations (or your mom's opinion) make you feel like you're a weirdo for wanting some time to date yourself. Embrace your freedom!

, If you are in a relationship where you are friends with someone but they want to date you, just remember that if you don't want to date them keep it in the friend zone. If they are truly your friend, they will understand. If you have been asked to date but you don't want to, tell them you'd rather be friends for now and not jump into things so quickly.


Let them decide whether they want to keep you in the friend-zone until you're ready or whether they find it better to go their separate ways. Whatever they choose, have knowledge in the fact that you were honest with them from the very beginning. Appreciate their decision just as they will hopefully respect yours and don't forget that if they truly like you, they will wait until you are ready. After all, if they don't wait, it's their loss!

Being together for an extended period of time helps build up team togetherness.Team spirit is important because a team that gets to know each other off the field will play better on the field.
 That is, create an environment based around respect and encouragement. If you encourage that type of environment, you'll build up your team spirit.One way you can push encouragement and respect is to actually set up guidelines about how your team can talk to each other. For instance, one of the guidelines could be no negative talk about another player during practice.
Lead by example. Though you may need to point out where a player needs to improve, always take time to acknowledge how a player is doing well.
 That is, ask your players to talk about what they bring to the team as individuals. These strengths don't need to just be baseball skills; they can also be personality traits, such as "always positive." By talking about what each individual can contribute, you start building up the team as a whole. Establish that you expect your team to show up on time every time you meet, both physically and mentally. You can establish them for your team, but you can also take some time to brainstorm them together.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> A two-seam fastball is gripped with the index and middle fingers on the two narrow seams of the baseball.
Make sure your fingers are relatively close together. Your fingers can either be positioned so that your middle finger runs along the seam, or so that the seam runs directly in the middle of both fingers. Experiment with what works best for you.
 Diametrically opposed just means that if you extended both fingers in the same direction, they would eventually form a perfect circle.


Think of the ball like a clock. If your thumb on a normal two-seam grip is at 6 o'clock, your thumb now should be at a 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock position.
 For right-handed pitchers, this means turning your wrist slightly to the left. For left-handed pitchers, this means turning your wrist slightly to the right.
 When throwing a two-seam fastball, put extra pressure on your middle finger. This will create a natural spin on the ball that will help it cut.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Make sure you have most of your weight on your back foot, ¬†As the pitch comes in, get ready to hit by "loading up", or stepping with your front foot (left foot if you're a right-handed batter, right foot if you're a left-handed batter) straight towards the pitching mound. A common mistake hitters will make is that they will "step out", or step behind them. This leads to either totally missing the ball or barely making contact.
The pitch is now coming towards the plate - time to make a decision. The strike zone is the length of the front of home plate and from the batter's shoulders to his or her knees. If the ball seems like it won't pass through that area, take the pitch; even if it ends up a strike, you have two more strikes before you're called out.


If the ball is probably going to be a strike, follow it with your eyes and turn your head to see it fully as it comes closer to home plate, not taking your eyes off of it.
 With your bat, practice going diagonally to the ball until you have it perfect.
 That would be great, except you haven't hit the ball yet. It is imperative that you make a conscious effort as you go to hit the ball that you keep your head looking at the ball. Bringing your head out results in foul tips/swings and misses.
 As you swing, make sure to continue just as fast as you were going when you went to hit the ball even after you have felt contact. Keep your hands steady and level the whole way through, and end with them above your front shoulder. Your hips should naturally have made a quick, powerful twist that has transferred the power of your swing to the ball.
 If you do, it means you're probably off-balance and thus your swing won't have much power to it. The way to fix balance in your swing is to become more familiar with it and even adjust if necessary.
 If all steps were followed, you've probably driven the ball a long way and you can start running to first base. Good luck.

 Summary: "
[92mWanted summary:[0m "
Find a batting stance that suits you.
Watch.
Some hitters will commonly drop their hands, meaning that instead of going in a diagonal path to the ball with your hands and bat like you should, the hitter will let his hands drop and swing in a straight line, resulting in either a swing and miss or a pop-up.
As you swing, your head may naturally turn away before the point of contact, ready to see where the ball went.
If you have followed all of these directions, you have probably made good contact with the ball on the sweet spot of the bat and you are now in a great position to do some damage to the other team.
As you end your swing, make sure you don't feel like your back foot has to move immediately.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Hold the ball so two seams are visible in the front and two visible in the back.The four-seam grip is considered by many pitchers as more effective when throwing a curveball than the two-seam grip. It allows the pitcher to throw the ball at any angle, as long as they hold their hand behind the ball and throw it with a snapping motion.Two-seam grips are used to throw fastballs. Rather than breaking down (as in a curveball), two-seam pitches break to the right or left.
Place the ball in the palm of your hand and flex your middle and index fingers so they grip the top of the ball.Curve your ring finger so the ball rests against its side. Place your middle finger along the middle seam (on the pinky side) and your thumb on the seam towards the back of the ball. At this point, your thumb should be positioned on the bottom of the ball opposite your middle finger, with these two fingers forming a "C" around the ball.Your grip should be firm, but not too tight. You want your thumb to be able to flick up behind the ball when it is released.
Do not choke the ball. Make sure there is a gap between your thumb and index finger, and small space between thumb and ring finger.
 When throwing a curveball, extend your wrist back. When you release, "snap" your thumb and middle finger together while flicking your wrist.At this point, your middle finger should rotate downwards and your thumb should rotate upwards to create the centripetal (circular) force needed to spin the ball towards the plate.Through a change-up curveball by increasing grip depth.Experiment with slight variations in grip depth and finger (thumb and middle) position.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> Using the middle of the free-throw stripe to position yourself can lead to an awkward 30 to 45 angle to the rim, and likely a bad free throw shot.Instead, hold the ball in your shooting hand. Then, stand in front of the basket and draw an invisible line from the ball in your hand to the rim of the basket.
Your right toes will be just to the left of center and your right arm should line up with the basket.
Positioning yourself this way will minimize your left-to-right or right-to-left movement and give you a more consistent free throw shot.
If you are a left handed shooter, you may want to practice a two handed free throw. It‚Äôs difficult to be an accurate shooter with two hands, so you can use your left hand as your shooting hand if it feels comfortable.
Some shooters keep their toes lined up behind the free throw line. Some shooters stagger their feet slightly. Try to find a stance where you feel balanced. You don‚Äôt want a lopsided stance as this will lead to a poor shot.If you are a right handed shooter, your left foot may be a bit further back from your right foot. If you‚Äôre a left handed shooter, your right foot may be a bit further back from your left foot. Don‚Äôt lean forward. Simply transfer your weight forward into your toes.


Keeping your back straight will keep you from stepping over the free throw line and getting a foul in a game.
 Your legs are what will provide the upward power for your shot. So you want to place your weight in your toes and bend your legs to access this power, or the ‚Äúup‚Äù motion.Some players find it more natural to stand with their knees straight and then initiate the shooting motion by dipping down and bending their knees. Then, they will straighten their knees as they go up for the shot, or a ‚Äúdown then up‚Äù motion. Do whatever technique feels comfortable and natural for you.
 Do not hold the ball in the palm of your shooting hand, as you won‚Äôt generate enough power from your palm to throw the ball properly.


Hold the ball so the black lines on the basketball are going across the ball. This will help with your throw.
There should be a little pocket of space between your palm and the ball.
Press your thumb, pointer and middle fingers against the ball to get a sense of the right hand placement. When you release the ball, those three fingers should be the last to touch the ball. This will give you a nice backspin, giving you a better chance of a successful shot.
 Hold the ball on the tops of the fingers of your shooting hand and place your other hand on the other side of the ball.


Your shooting hand should be under the ball and your free hand should be beside the ball. It will act as your guide hand and make sure the ball stays balanced as you take the free throw.
 Don‚Äôt let your elbow flap out to one side. Scoop it down and up so it is close to your body and in line with the rim. It should make an ‚ÄúL‚Äù shape.
 As you shoot, don‚Äôt take your eyes off the target! Lock your eyes on the rim, not the ball. The sudden jerk of your head from the rim to the ball will throw off your shot.
 Your thumb, pointer and middle finger should be the last to touch the ball. This will give you a nice backspin or rotation on the ball.


Make sure you come up on your toes as you release the ball. Coming up on your toes will ensure you are releasing as much power as possible from your legs into the shot.
Make sure your back is straight and you aren‚Äôt lunging forward with your upper body.
If you miss the basket by a few feet, this means you may need more power. Adjust this by jumping a little on your release to give your shot more power.
If you overshoot the basket, you may need less power in your throw. Adjust this by throwing with less force and further back from the free throw line.
 Keep your shooting hand up in a ‚Äúgooseneck‚Äù after you release the ball, until it goes into the net. You should be up on your toes and looking at the rim, not the ball in the air or as it lands in the rim.
 A big part of a successful free throw shot in maintaining your focus and technique on every free throw. The only way to do this is to practice your free throw technique every day, at every practice until it becomes natural and almost like second nature. That way, when you are at the free throw line during a game, with one five seconds to go, surrounded by all the noise of the fans, you can simply focus on the rim and make the free throw, just like you practiced.Try to shoot 25 shots every day for 5 days of each week. Keep track of how many free throws you make and how many you miss. If you aren‚Äôt making more than you miss, there may be a flaw in your technique. So evaluate your level of success and adjust your stance or your arm placement accordingly.As you practice, think: BEEF. Balance the ball, keep your Eye on the rim, keep your Elbow straight, and Follow through. Because a free throw does not involve defense, you can create a small ritual or routine before you make your shot. For example, every time Michael Jordan took a free throw, he followed the same ritual: spin the ball, dribble three times, spin the ball again, and then shoot. Relying on a ritual that you have practiced many times will relax and focus you before you take the shot.Create your own small ritual during your free throw practice. Start every free throw with this ritual so it feels natural and comfortable.
 This can help you with your distance control, which is the control you have over how far or how short the ball goes when you shoot it.Stand 9 inches in front of the free throw line. Maintaining your free throw technique, shoot the ball, aiming for the back of the rim. Do this several times, missing the shot, but aiming at the back of the rim.
Move 9 inches behind the line and hit the front of rim on each shot. Do this several time, missing the shot but hitting the front of the rim.
Finally, move back to the free throw line and get into your free throw position. Try to swish each shot, using the same distance control you used in the previous spots on the court.
 This may sound impossible, especially when you are just starting to get comfortable with your free throw technique. But once you develop a good technique and your technique feels comfortable through practice, you should be able to close your eyes, shoot, and swish the ball. Summary: "

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> With their non-hitting hand, kids should toss the ball in the air slightly in front of them. Their tossing hand shouldn‚Äôt move too much and the ball shouldn‚Äôt go too high. If the ball is thrown very high, then it will be moving faster and more difficult to hit. Aim for about 2ft (.6m) above the head and about 2ft (.6m) in front of them.The key to a good serve is to keep it simple. It should all be one smooth, fluid movement.
 Kids need to take a large step forward in the direction that they wish to hit the ball. This will help them to generate enough power to hit the ball over the net. They should step forward with the foot on the same side as their hitting hand. Their hitting arm should be extended above their head and they should hit the ball with the heel of their hand. This will help the ball to go the furthest without spinning. The arm should follow through after hitting the ball until the hand is down by their thigh.The hand should be completely open when hitting the ball.
The ball should be hit as it is descending from its toss. The kids should reach up towards the ball to make sure their arm is fully extended.
 They can stand several feet away from a wall and practice serving the ball against the wall. They can form pairs with one child on each side of the net and practice hitting it over. The key to getting a good serve is lots and lots of practice.The toss, step, and hit should all happen in one fluid motion.
Some kids won't be able to serve across the full court. You can have them stand closer to the net so that they can practice hitting the ball over.
 To serve the ball underhand, they can toss the ball and step forward, but they will move their hitting hand down by their side and then swing it forward instead raising it up in the air. They will hit the ball over the net with their fist. This method is the easiest for making contact with the ball.An underhand serve is easier for younger players, but they should still be practicing the overhand serve so that they can learn it and be able to do it eventually.

This works because one base per Hit takes care of all the singles. Since this also awards one base for each double, you only need to add 1 more base per double to find the total. Similarly, add two extra bases for triples, and three extra for home runs.

[92mPrompt:[0m "</s> There are two basic types of shin guards. One type has attached ankle straps, which wrap under the foot and provides support and ankle protection. The other type simply slides under your socks and protect just your shins. For players under 12 the added ankle support is crucial for safety and comfort.Currently, there are some hybrid guards that come down to cover the ankle but don't actually wrap around it. These tend to be more expensive, however, as they need a very precise fit.
As players grow more serious about soccer, they tend to find the ankle-guards too bulky, as they can limit your foot's range of motion. By ages 10-12, many youth players switch to slide-ins, which you simply push under the socks. They do not cover your ankles. While slightly less protective, the added speed is essential for higher levels of competition.
 Shin guards come in the standard sizes from x-small all the way to XL, but just because you wear a large jersey doesn't mean you need a large guard. For the most part, let height be your guide:



Small: 0 - 5'2" (0 - 160cm)

Medium: 5'2" - 5'10" (160cm - 180cm)

Large: 5'10" - 6'4" (180cm - 195cm)

X-Large: 6'4" + (195cm and up), While the guide above is best for 90% of players, everyone is different. As a rule of thumb, you want the guard to cover from below the knee to right before your ankle bends.
 Professional players actually have guards that are custom-molded to their shins. While this is overkill for youth soccer, the basic idea is a good one -- you want snug, complete protection around your shins. When looking at your legs from the front, the shinguard should cover the entire width of your leg.


Most shin guards can be lightly bent with your fingers to curve them to your leg. Do not yank on them, however, as this can cause them to weaken. The best way to buy guards is to see what feels comfortable. When going to the store, bring a pair of long soccer socks with you. Slide the guards on and walk around a bit, even jogging if possible, and see if they stay snugly in place. They should be comfortable and cover the majority of your leg.
